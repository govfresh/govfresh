The new beta of U.S. Department of State's <a href="http://ForeignAssistance.gov">ForeignAssistance.gov</a> shows how government can leverage the power of data and visualizations to communicate the story behind its mission deliverables.

The country and category pages, <a href="http://beta.foreignassistance.gov/explore/country/Tanzania">Tanzania</a> and <a href="http://beta.foreignassistance.gov/categories/Economic-Development">economic development</a> for example, are beautifully done with concise text and clean, flat layouts. The <a href="http://beta.foreignassistance.gov/explore">explore feature</a> visually shows where money is allocated using a drill-down map that makes it easier to see how foreign assistance is being distributed globally. The "download data" feature is prominently accessible everywhere.

According to State, the project took a year to develop. ForeignAssistance.gov first launched in 2010 to "increase aid transparency and serve as a mechanism for users to view, analyze, and track foreign assistance data from across the U.S. Government."
