"The First State" will become the twenty-fourth state website to be managed by e-government services firm NIC Inc.

NIC announced that its Dover-based subsidiary, Delaware Interactive, was awarded a three-year contract to develop and manage the Delaware state website, delaware.gov. The contract includes three one-year renewals that extend through September 2017. 

According to the announcement, "the state will pay Delaware Interactive an annual portal management fee. Delaware Interactive will also work with state agencies to develop new online services under the self-funded, transaction-based model."
