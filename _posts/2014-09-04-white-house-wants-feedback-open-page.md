The White House is looking for input on how it can improve the open government section of its website, located at <a href="http://whitehouse.gov/open">whitehouse.gov/open</a>.

"If youâ€™re familiar with the history of the page, you can see we have begun updating it by shifting some of the existing content and adding new tabs and material," White House Senior Advisor for Open Government Corinna Zarek wrote in an email asking for public input.

Feedback can be emailed to <a href="mailto:opengov@ostp.gov">opengov@ostp.gov</a> or shared via Twitter to the <a href="http://twitter.com/OpenGov">@OpenGov</a> account.
