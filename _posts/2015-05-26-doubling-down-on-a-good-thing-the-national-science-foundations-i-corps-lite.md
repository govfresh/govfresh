I’ve known <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/edmund-pendleton/6/631/3ba" target="_blank">Edmund Pendleton</a> from the University of Maryland as the Director of the <a href="http://www.dcicorps.org/" target="_blank">D.C. National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps Node</a> (a collaboration among the University of Maryland, Virginia Tech, George Washington, and Johns Hopkins).

But it wasn’t until seeing him lead the <a href="http://steveblank.com/2014/12/17/i-corps-at-the-nih-evidence-based-translational-medicine/" target="_blank">first I-Corps class at the National Institutes of Health</a> that I realized Edmund could teach my class better than I can.

After seeing the results of 500+ teams through the I-Corps, the NSF now offers all teams who’ve received government funding to start a company an introduction to building a Lean Startup<em>.</em>

Here’s Edmund’s description of the I-Corps Lite program.

<h2>SBIR/STTR program and startup seed funding</h2>

The Small Business Innovative Research (<a href="https://www.sbir.gov/about" target="_blank">SBIR</a>) and Small Business Technology Transfer (<a href="https://www.sbir.gov/about" target="_blank">STTR</a>) programs are startup seed funds created by Congress to encourage U.S. small businesses to turn Government-funded research into commercial businesses. Eleven U.S. agencies participate in the SBIR/STTR program, with DOD, HHS (NIH), NSF, DOE, and NASA offering the majority of funding opportunities.

The SBIR/STTR program made <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/SBA_OII_SBIR_STTR_Presentation_for_General_Public_3-20-15.pdf" target="_blank">~6,200 seed stage investments</a> in 2014, dwarfing the seed investments made by venture capital. The SBIR/STTR program represents a <em>critical</em> source of seed funding for U.S. startups that don’t fit whatever’s hot in venture capital. In fact, half of all seed stages in tech companies in the U.S. were funded by the SBIR program.

<h2>The SBIR/STTR program</h2>

The <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/topics.jsp" target="_blank">SBIR/STTR program</a> funds companies in <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/about/about-sbir" target="_blank">three phases</a>. Phase I funding is for teams to prove feasibility, both technical and commercial.

Since most of the founders come from strong technical roots, companies in Phase I tend to focus on the technology – and spend very little time understanding what it takes to turn the company’s technology into a scalable and repeatable commercial business.



In 2011 the National Science Foundation recognized that many of the innovators they were funding were failing – not from an inability to make their technologies work – but because they did not understand how to translate the technology into a successful business. To address this problem, the NSF collaborated with Steve Blank to adapt his Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford for NSF-funded founders. By focusing on hypothesis testing, the Lean LaunchPad had actually developed something akin to the scientific method for entrepreneurship. (see <a href="http://steveblank.com/2011/07/28/eureka-a-new-era-for-scientists-and-engineers/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/about.jsp" target="_blank">here</a> and the results <a href="http://steveblank.com/2012/06/11/making-a-dent-in-the-universe-results-from-the-nsf-i-corps/" target="_blank">here</a>.) This was an approach that would immediately make sense to the scientists and technologists NSF was funding. Steve and the NSF collaborated on adapting his curriculum and the result was the 9-week NSF I-Corps program.

NSF’s original I-Corps program was specifically designed for academic innovators still in the lab; fundamentally, to help them determine the best path to commercialization before they moved to the start-up stage. (I-Corps participants are at the “pre-company” stage.) But NSF realized the Lean LaunchPad approach would be equally beneficial for the many startups they fund through the SBIR/STTR program.

<h2>The “Beat the Odds” bootcamp – an I-Corps “Lite”</h2>

The good news is that the NSF found that the I-Corps program works spectacularly well. But the class requires a substantial time commitment for the founding team to get out of the building and talk to 10-15 customers a week, and then present what they learned – the class is essentially a full time commitment.

Was there a way to <em>expose every one of ~240 companies/year</em> who receive a NSF grant to the I-Corps? The NSF decided to pilot <em>a “Beat the Odds Boot Camp” (essentially an I-Corps Lite)</em> at the biannual gathering of new SBIR/STTR Phase I grantees in Washington.

Steve provided an overview of the Lean LaunchPad methodology in an introductory webinar. Then the companies were sent off to do customer discovery before coming to an <em>optional</em> “bootcamp workshop” 12 weeks later. Four certified I-Corps instructors provided feedback to these companies at the workshop. The results of the pilot were excellent. The participating companies learned a significant amount about their business models, even in this very light-touch approach. The NSF SBIR/STTR program had found a way to improve the odds of building a successful company.

<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/icorps-lite-plus-sbir.jpg"></a>

During the past two years, I’ve taken the lead to expand and head up this program, building on what Steve started. We now <em>require</em> the participating companies to attend kick-off and mid-point webinars, and <em>to conduct 30 customer interviews over the twelve-week program</em>. The companies present to I-Corps instructors at a “Beat the Odds Bootcamp” – the day before the biannual <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/events/event_summ.jsp?cntn_id=134419&amp;org=NSF" target="_blank">NSF Phase I Grantee Workshop</a>.

In March we conducted our fourth iteration of this workshop with a record number of companies participating (about 110 of 120, or 90%) and 14 certified I-Corps instructors giving feedback to teams. This time, we added afternoon one-on-one sessions with the teams in addition to group presentations in the morning. Companies are very happy with the program, and many have requested even more face time with I-Corps instructors throughout the process.

The smart companies in Phase I realize that this Bootcamp program provides a solid foundation for success in Phase II, when more dollars are available.

<h2>What’s next</h2>

Currently, once these teams leave I-Corps Lite, they do not have any “formal” touch points with their instructors. Over time, we hope to offer more services to the teams and develop a version of I-Corps (I-Corps-Next?) for Phase II grantees.

We envision even greater startup successes if SBIR/STTR funded teams can take advantage of I-Corps classes through their entire life cycle:
<ul>
	<li>“Pre-company” academic researchers – current I-Corps</li>
	<li>Phase I SBIR/STTR teams – current I-Corps Lite</li>
	<li>Phase II SBIR/STTR teams – develop a new I-Corps Next class</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/icorps-next-plus-sbir-ii-and-iii.png"></a>

The emphasis and format would change for each, but all would be solidly rooted in the Lean LaunchPad methodology. And of course, we don’t want to stop with only NSF teams/companies…as we all know. The opportunity is huge, and we can have a significant impact on the country’s innovation ecosystem.

<h2>Summary</h2>

NSF led the development of the SBIR program in the late 1970s. It has since been adopted by the entire federal research community. We believe NSF’s leadership with I-Corps will deliver something of equal significance… a program that teaches scientists and engineers what it takes to turn those research projects into products and services for the benefit of society.  I-Corps Lite is one more piece of that program.

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>The SBIR/STTR program is a critical source of seed funding for technology startups that don’t fit the “whatever’s hot” category for venture capital</li>
	<li>The program is a national treasure and envied around the world, but we can (and should) improve it.</li>
	<li>SBIR/STTR Phase I applicants needed more help with “commercial feasibility”…a perfect fit for business model design, customer discovery and agile engineering – so we rolled out the NSF I-Corps</li>
	<li>The I-Corps was so successful we wanted more NSF funded entrepreneneurs, not just a select few, to be exposed to the Lean methodology – so we built I-Corps Lite</li>
</ul>
