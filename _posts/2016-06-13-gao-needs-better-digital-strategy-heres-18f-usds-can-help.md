The U.S. Government Accountability Office released a <a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-733T">report</a> on the fiscal and administrative state of 18F and the U.S. Digital Service, both established to make federal government digital services work better for users, and it appears the agency could use some help from the two on its own website, <a href="http://gao.gov">gao.gov</a>.

Here are four ways GAO's digital operations must be rebooted to meet the needs of today's web user, and how 18F and USDS helped us better understand all of this.

<h2>HTTPS</h2>

<a href="https://pulse.cio.gov/https/domains/#q=gao.gov">The GAO website is not secure for users visiting gao.gov</a>. 

As 18F has emphasized, <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/11/13/why-we-use-https-in-every-gov-website-we-make/">HTTPS</a> protects visitor privacy with a secure, encrypted connection and is an important practice for .gov domains to adhere to.

The move to <a href="https://https.cio.gov/">HTTS</a> for all .gov websites <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/06/08/the-us-government-is-moving-to-https-everywhere/">began more than a year ago</a>, yet gao.gov still remains unencrypted.

Fortunately for GAO, 18F and USDS created a number of <a href="https://https.cio.gov/">HTTPS</a> <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/07/16/introduction-to-https-webinar/">resources</a> for governments and agencies having difficulty understanding its importance and quickly adopting it. 

<h2>Mobile-friendly</h2>

<a href="http://www.responsinator.com/?url=www.gao.gov%2Findex.html">The GAO website is not mobile-friendly.</a>

Whether it's a phone, tablet or laptop, gao.gov doesn't adapt to the device you're using. As billions of people around the world are now using mobile devices to access information, it's requisite that all government websites are mobile-friendly so their services are accessible to everyone.

Fortunately for GAO, 18F and USDS created the <a href="https://standards.usa.gov/">U.S. Web Design Standards</a> that makes it easy for anyone creating government websites to build mobile-friendly sites (including accessible color schemes, which <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/report#/gao.gov">GAO does a mediocre job on</a>).

<em>Update:

<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile/status/742448747435675648">Alex Howard notes</a> that GAO has a separate mobile version (launched in 2010) of its website and an app (launched in 2012). While these were great technological enhancements at the time, they no longer meet today's standards around responsive design and streamlined development practices.

Rather than building one site that adapts to all devices, GAO has created two development environments and duplicated development costs. 

While an app is certainly mobile, it doesn't qualify in this case, as it's a secondary outlet to the website.
</em>

<h2>Open data</h2>

GAO does not have a comprehensive open data strategy.

While the site provides a <a href="http://www.gao.gov/feeds.html">great list of RSS feeds</a>, not all reports are in data-friendly formats (all are, however, in PDFs). There also appears to be no public application programming interface (however Sunlight Foundation has created one via its <a href="https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/documents.html">Sunlight Congress API</a>).

Unsurprisingly, GAO's report on 18F and USDS isn't available through an open, accessible, digital format.

Fortunately for GAO, while not directly created by 18F or USDS, but done by many who now serve in each, there is <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/">Project Open Data</a> to help it get started on executing an effective open data strategy.

<h2>Analytics</h2>

<a href="https://pulse.cio.gov/analytics/domains/#q=gao.gov">GAO doesn't participate</a> in the federal government's <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a>.

As the agency that provides oversight on federal government activities, it would be great to have more transparency into its website analytics.

Given that gao.gov is already using Google Analytics, and familiar with its tools, this is easily resolved with a simple snippet of code provided by DAP.

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

I get nervous when policymakers take a myopic approach to assessing technology, especially in a politically charged environment like Washington, D.C., where there are behind-the-scenes personal and business relationships that impact motivations around critiquing new initiatives like 18F and USDS. 

I especially get nervous when an agency charged with overseeing federal government technology practices fails the digital test.

If GAO is serious about modernizing its own digital strategy, 18F and USDS can surely help.
