A big win for government open source advocates, platform as a service provider <a href="http://www.blackmesh.com/">BlackMesh</a> has achieved Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program compliance through its SecureCloud offering.

The company's authority to operate, granted in May, was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. The agency has worked with BlackMesh since 2010. According to the company, the process took nearly a year, starting in May 2014 with official authorization granted in April.

BlackMesh provides cloud services based on OpenStack and OpenShift.

<a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/about-us/about/">FedRAMP</a> is the federal government's program aimed at making it easier for agencies to adopt cloud services under the “do once, use many times” mantra. Once cloud vendors have met FedRAMP's security protocol, any agency can quickly procure the services safely knowing they meet federal standards.

BlackMesh was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Ashburn, Va., with U.S. servers located in Reston and Las Vegas.
