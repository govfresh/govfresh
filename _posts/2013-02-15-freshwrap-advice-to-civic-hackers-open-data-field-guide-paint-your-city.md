There were a ton of great civic stories this week. I used to do a weekly "FreshWrap" highlighting these, and I'll try do this regularly when I can, so here's the first attempt back.

Here's what made my radar this week.

Commentary on Knight's open government challenge includes <a href="http://techpresident.com/news/23492/five-things-you-ought-know-if-youre-getting-started-civic-hacking">civic hacking advice</a> from TechPresident Managing Editor <a href="https://twitter.com/nclarkjudd">Nick Judd</a> and <a href="http://techpresident.com/news/23500/twelve-more-pieces-advice-civic-hackers">a reply</a> from Philadelphia Chief Data Officer <a href="http://twitter.com/mheadd">Mark Headd</a> and Upworthy senior engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanResella">Ryan Resella</a>.
