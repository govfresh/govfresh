The Welsh Government released a <a href="http://gov.wales/docs/dsjlg/publications/localgov/151028-why-local-government-must-go-digitial-en.pdf">report</a> of its findings on how local government in Wales can better leverage digital technologies and realize significant savings while still providing quality, scalable citizen services.

The report includes local and national government anecdotes and recommendations for a Welsh Digital Framework that would help Wales progress faster with respect to technology and social media solutions.

Key excerpt:

<blockquote>Camden recognises that digital is a critical option for delivering savings. The authority is expected to see its £350m budget reduced by £70m by 2017-18. Camden have identified that £50m of these savings will come from digital. They also acknowledge that not all digital requirements can be met in-house and that the private sector can make a strategic contribution. Rather than the private sector driving the strategy, in Camden it is often the supplier of infrastructure (cloud-hosting/email).</blockquote>
