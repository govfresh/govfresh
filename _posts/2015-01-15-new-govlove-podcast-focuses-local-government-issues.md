Podcasting is all the rage these days, and SeeClickFix is now in the mix with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/govloves-podcast/id956895003?mt=2">GovLove</a>, focused on local government issues.

The first episode features <a href="http://elgl.org">Emerging Local Government Leaders</a> co-founder Kent Wyatt, a great, new organization bringing a fresh approach to public sector engagement and community. 

Kudos to SeeClickFix for expanding beyond traditional marketing and putting the focus on the community, providing interesting, valuable content, and making it less directly about its own brand. While there's some mention of SeeClickFix is the first episode, hopefully it doesn't turn into a customer spotlight program (Ben Berkowitz, are you reading this?).
