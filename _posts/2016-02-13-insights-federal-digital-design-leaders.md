Ethan Marcotte and Karen McGrane have been on a roll lately featuring federal <a href="http://responsivewebdesign.com/tag/government">government design leaders</a> on their <a href="http://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/">Responsive Web Design Podcast</a>.

The <a href="http://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/usds/">first episode</a>, with U.S. Digital Service Designer Mollie Ruskin and Lead Front End Designer Julia Elman sharing insights into their design process and prototyping tools (<a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle">OmniGraffle</a>, <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>, <a href="http://GitHub.com">GitHub</a>) and building the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/">U.S. Web Design Standards</a>, has excellent insights for those focused on this aspect of the civic experience.

Favorite quote from Mollie:

<blockquote>
"I think that one thing that you have to just come to terms with in doing a project like this is that there are so many moving pieces and it’s a lot to keep track of all at the same time, and just to sort of like take a meditative, reasoned approach to that because it can be a daunting amount. I had been given that advice before I started, and it was about halfway through that I felt the zen of all of the pieces moving and realized that that was part of the beauty of doing this work, is that by us taking on this complex important problem, we were going to be making it easier for others moving forward. So, I would just encourage a can-do attitude and plow through those times where you feel like you’re building seventeen things all at once, because you will be."
