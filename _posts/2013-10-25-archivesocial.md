<h2>What</h2>

<h2>Give us the 140-character elevator pitch.</h2>

ArchiveSocial enables public sector organizations to embrace social media by minimizing risk and eliminating compliance barriers.

<h2>What problem does ArchiveSocial solve for government?</h2>

Laws requiring “freedom of information”, and hence record retention, are critical for government transparency. Governments at all levels are struggling with social media records, and most are non-compliant. It is often cited as a top 5 technology issue, and many public entities are limiting usage or refraining from social media entirely.

ArchiveSocial eliminates the compliance risk that is (a) preventing some government agencies, especially at the municipal level, from having any social media presence, and (b) preventing those agencies that do have social media accounts from fully engaging with citizens and not just using these platforms as one-way communications tools.

Citizens benefit from increased engagement with their government, and the promise of government transparency (i.e. freedom of information) being fulfilled.

<h2>What’s the story behind starting ArchiveSocial?</h2>

In 2011, Anil Chawla was developing consumer social media applications when he stumbled upon the idea for ArchiveSocial. It was clear that social media had become an "official" communication channel for most businesses and government agencies, but that these organizations were struggling with record keeping. 

He originally intended ArchiveSocial for private businesses in regulated industries, but while talking to a friend at a brewery, heard that some government colleagues were copying and pasting tweets in order to satisfy open records requirements. As it often happens with beer, he had a eureka moment: retention of social media records was becoming a major pain-point across the public sector, and ArchiveSocial had exactly the right technology to solve it.

ArchiveSocial started a pilot archive with the North Carolina State Archives -- a leader in digital preservation efforts -- in early 2012, and soon after we began reaching out to municipal governments. Within a year, ArchiveSocial had acquired state &amp; local government customers across more than a dozen US states and was archiving social media for federal agencies such as U.S. National Archives. We also worked with government partners such as North Carolina, South Carolina and the City of Austin to launch <a href="http://austintexas.gov.archivesocial.com/" target="_blank">Open Archives</a> of their social media records. The strong need for our technology, and the overwhelmingly positive response in government, inspired us to focus on the public sector and ultimately led us to <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/2013/08/16/archivesocial/" target="_blank">joining the Code for America accelerator</a> this year.

<h2>What are its key features?</h2>

ArchiveSocial is a robust social media archiving solution that goes well beyond a simple data capture to ensure that records are maintained in a forensically sound fashion. It archives additional content related to the record such as high-resolution photos and background images. It preserves relationships between records and ensures that the necessary context is maintained in the archive. Most importantly, ArchiveSocial is designed so that government agencies can easily locate and make sense of the records when they need them.

ArchiveSocial is a pure SaaS solution, and allows any sized organization to start archiving in minutes with zero IT deployment.

<h2>What are the costs, pricing plans?</h2>

Customers pay based on the number of records they produce in a month, starting at $49 per month for up to 100 records. We offer a <a href="http://archivesocial.com/?utm_source=govfresh&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=free-trial&amp;utm_campaign=govfresh+feature#sample-archive" target="_blank">free 30 day trial</a> (no credit card required) on our website.
