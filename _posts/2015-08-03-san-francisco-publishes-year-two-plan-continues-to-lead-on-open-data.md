San Francisco's <a href="http://datasf.org">DataSF</a> team continues to quietly and effectively demonstrate what an efficient, holistic and personable approach to open data looks like with the <a href="http://www.sfmayor.org/index.aspx?recordid=927&amp;page=846">announcement</a> of its <a href="http://datasf.org/blog/announcing-our-year-2-plan/">year two plan</a> and retrospective of the past year.

SF Chief Data Officer Joy Bonaguro and Open Data Program Manager Jason Lally are a dynamic duo building the blueprint for government open data offices and initiatives. According to the city, <span class="s1">DataSF has 264 published datasets and 740 inventoried datasets, but the number isn't as important as the approach they've taken since Bonaguro <a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2014/03/sf-gets-chief-data-officer/">was appointed</a> a little over a year ago.</span>

Key to their success is having a long-game plan, building internal community, education and awareness and bringing a sense of aesthetic and uniformity to SF's open data initiative.

Also, I love the "love" messaging throughout the collateral ("Written with LOVE in San Francisco.", "Made with &lt;3 in San Francisco"), as it humanizes the efforts more, making data less about the technical and more about the people.
