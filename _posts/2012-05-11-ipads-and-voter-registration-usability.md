Open Source Digital Voting Foundation's John Sebes <a href="http://www.trustthevote.org/new-citizens-adding-usability-to-the-voter-registration-process">writes about</a> watching new citizens complete voter registration application forms and the associated usability issues, especially for older, less tech-savvy demographic.

<blockquote>"For these people, the application form might well be daunting: two pages of instructions in small font in addition to a form with little boxes that are hard to read for anyone, much less a user of reading glasses. And for those who actually read the instructions, there is some real confusion over whether you can vote if you lack a driver’s license or SSN. (I expect that some people lacked one or maybe both.) More vexing, the elections department people told me how conscious they were about people’s need for help in doing the application form correctly, and having to deal with more paperwork, and having to take the initiative to walk over to speak to more government people, in order to get the help.

In fact, one of them said that they wished they had the voter registration form on an iPad, and each of them could work the crowd with iPad in hand to get people filling the form with as large print as needed, in whatever language was convenient, with as much online assistance as possible, and no pages of daunting instructions."</blockquote>
