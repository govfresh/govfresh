After several years of talking about and conceptualizing, and months of development, I'm proud to formally (and finally) announce the release <a href="https://govpress.govfresh.org">GovPress</a>, a simple, elegant WordPress theme for government.

Since we launched version 1.0 just a few months ago, it has been downloaded <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/govpress/stats/">more than 30,000 times</a> from WordPress.org by governments, nonprofits and educational institutions around the world.

For those who've been following our work on this project, the original iteration was called GovFresh WP, however, we renamed it GovPress for the formal release so that it met WordPress branding guidelines and could be included in the official WordPress theme gallery.

The entire process of bringing GovPress to market has been an amazing experience, getting feedback, questions and, especially, thank you notes from people all over the world. I've learned a ton about building a solid civic hacking project and will soon write more about this so that it may help others working through their own ideas.

Finally, I can't thank <a href="http://wptheming.com/">Devin Price</a> enough for all his support in making this happen.

So:
