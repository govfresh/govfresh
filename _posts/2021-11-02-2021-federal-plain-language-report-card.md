The Center for Plain Language issued its yearly [plain language report card](https://centerforplainlanguage.org/2021-federal-plain-language-report-card/). This year's focus was on the main Freedom of Information Act request and Coronavirus pages of 21 executive branch agencies.

"Agencies earned grades between A and F for both organizational compliance, covering the staffing, training, and annual reporting required by the Plain Writing Act, and writing quality, focusing on how easy it is to find, understand, and use information the public needs," said the Center for Plain Language referencing the 2021 report card.

On writing:

> Overall the average writing grade was a B-, unchanged from last year. But this yearâ€™s average was pulled down by poor marks for the FOIA Request pages, where the average grade was a C+.  Within that average is a far more positive story:  agencies are doing a better job communicating about the pandemic.

On compliance:

> Two-thirds of agencies surveyed this year earned an A on organizational compliance (how well they meet the staffing, training, and annual reporting requirements of the 2010 Plain Writing Act).

Center for Plain Language included examplary examples of FOIA and Coronavirus pages to support those looking for guidance.
