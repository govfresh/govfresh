There's been a <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/+ClayJohnson/posts/jCzYymGKCvp">great deal</a> of <a href="http://waldo.jaquith.org/blog/2011/08/govt-apps-contests/">discussion</a> around the <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/07/app-outreach-and-sustainabilit.html">value</a> of civic apps contests, and now <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024484.do">there's a book for that</a>.

<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024484.do">Civic Apps Competition Handbook</a>, written by Kate Eyler-Werve and Virginia Carlson and published by O'Reilly Media, doesn't focus on the debate, but does provide a great guide to anyone interested in organizing one.
