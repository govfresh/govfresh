<!-- paragraph -->
<p>Undoubtedly, this service will be desired by government officials for administrative efficiency's sake, but will also become more of a public demand. While every Department of Motor Vehicles could use a virtual queuing service like Whyline, even more impactful will be the time those in need will save not having to wait in line for social services benefits. For the latter, that time is lost opportunity not working.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"Technology played a critical role in how state and local leaders navigated the uncertainties of 2020, and as government agencies look to what's next, we see Whyline as a critical technology that allows agencies to modernize their workflows, safely reopen, and adapt their operations to the new hybrid normal," said Dustin Haisler, Chief Innovation Officer of e.Republic. "We see significant synergies in Whyline's goals and our capabilities and are overly ecstatic about the possibilities of what we can accomplish together."<br><br>…<br><br>In 2015, Whyline was founded to help governments and companies manage the flow of people through the use of virtual queues and ‘smart’ appointment scheduling. Built with hyper- automation and cloud computing, Whyline’s clients’ customers can see the live wait-times, enter into the queue remotely or pre-book their appointment, and let the software wait on their behalf until it's their turn to be seen.<br><br>Amidst the global pandemic, Whyline has seen unprecedented growth rates in organic demand, annual recurring revenue, overall system usage and a 650% increase in contract signings. Whyline’s solution has shown to be perfectly positioned to assist the healthcare, government, financial institution and retail sectors during the COVID crisis across geographies; and is also well-positioned to continue experiencing strong growth in post-pandemic times as consumer behavior has quickly evolved to what has become the 'new normal.'</p></blockquote>
