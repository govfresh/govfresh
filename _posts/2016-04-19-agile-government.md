<a href="http://agilegovleaders.org">Agile Government Leadership</a> has created <a href="http://www.agilegovleaders.org/academy/">AGL Academy</a> to help public sector professionals (and their supporting vendors) learn more about agile development practices in the context of government.

The first course, "<a href="http://www.agilegovleaders.org/academy/project-manager/">Agile for the Government Project Manager</a>," is self-guided, but AGL Working Group members are offering a free webinar to walk through the components of each lesson.
