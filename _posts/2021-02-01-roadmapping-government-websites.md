<p>What's great about about the public roadmap, particularly for large government institutions, is that they show there is a plan, but they are also a powerful demonstration of civic openness. More digital teams should expose and actively socialize this both as an exercise in transparency, but also as an entree to deeper civic engagement.</p>
