NASA received 195 comments from the public in respose to a June 2021 request for information entitled, “Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities in NASA Programs, Contracts and Grants.”

From the [release](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/public-provides-nasa-ideas-for-engaging-untapped-communities):

> NASA requested public feedback about how it can provide underserved communities with equal access to the opportunities the agency creates. NASA specifically asked for feedback on possible opportunities to leverage NASA assets to help underserved communities, and barriers to accessing current NASA grants, programs, and procurements. The agency also worked to engage with organizations and individuals from underserved and underrepresented communities.
