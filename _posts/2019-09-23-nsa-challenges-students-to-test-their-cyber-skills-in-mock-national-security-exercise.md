<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The annual Codebreaker Challenge offers students a closer look at the  type of work done at NSA and provides the opportunity to develop skills  needed to achieve the Agency’s national security mission. The problems  touch on skills like software reverse engineering, cryptanalysis,  exploit development, block chain analysis and more.</p><p>This year’s challenge scenario is about tech savvy terrorists who  have developed a new suite of communication tools that are being used  for attack planning purposes. Intelligence suggests the terrorists are  communicating via TerrorTime, a custom Android secure messaging app.  Those who attempt the challenge will be required to reverse engineer and  develop new exploitation capabilities against TerrorTime to enable  message spoofing, user masquerades, and message decryption.</p></blockquote>
