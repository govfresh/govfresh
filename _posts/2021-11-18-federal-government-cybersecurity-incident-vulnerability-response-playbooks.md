The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency has published [Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/11/16/new-federal-government-cybersecurity-incident-and-vulnerability) to "provide federal civilian executive branch agencies with operational procedures for planning and conducting cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities."

"Although CISA created the playbooks for FCEB agencies, we encourage critical infrastructure entities; state, local, territorial, and tribal government organizations; and private sector organizations to review them to benchmark their own vulnerability and incident response practices," says CISA.

The playbooks are in response to the White House [Executive Order (EO) 14028: Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) focused on removing barriers to sharing threat information.
