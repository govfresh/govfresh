When President John F. Kennedy famously proclaimed "Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country," a sense of civic pride was embedded into our patriotic psyche and Americans were given the money quote needed to do more than just complain about their government.

As municipalities struggle to make ends meet, here are five ways you can do for your city.

<h2>Camp</h2>

<a href="http://citycamp.govfresh.com"></a><a href="http://citycamp.govfresh.com/start-a-camp/">Start a CityCamp</a> where you live. CityCamp is an unconference focused on innovation for municipal governments and community organizations. Founded by <a href="http://twitter.com/kmcurry">Kevin Curry</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/pahlkadot">Jen Pahlka</a>, the first camp was held in Chicago, Illinois, January 23-24, 2010. To date, camps have been held in <a href="http://citycampsf.govfresh.com">San Francisco</a>, <a href="http://citycampldn.govfresh.com">London</a>, <a href="http://citycampco.govfresh.com">Colorado</a>, <a href="http://citycampyeg.govfresh.com">Edmonton</a> and <a href="http://citycamp.govfresh.com/cities/">many other cities</a> across the world.
