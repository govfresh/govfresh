The General Services Administration has issued a request for information related to the federal government's use of software-as-a-service.

From the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/154002">announcement</a>:

<blockquote>Unified Shared Services Management (USSM), with the guidance of the Shared Services Governance Board, is seeking information from industry to understand their capability to provide standardized solutions across administrative services, as referenced in Office of Management and Budget memorandum M-16-11.

The RFI inquires about interoperable and modular approaches to delivering common technology solutions and requests feedback on the viability of the Federal Integrated Business Framework as a documentation source to inform the development of a software-as-a-service offering. The RFI also solicits input on the potential opportunities for public-private partnership funding models.</blockquote>
