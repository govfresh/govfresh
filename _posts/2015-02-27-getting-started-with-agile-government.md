Yesterday, I participated in an <a href="http://agilegovleaders.org">Agile Government Leadership</a> panel discussion on "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQxd96-4vqs">Agile Government 101</a>."

Fellow panelists included Laura Stanton (General Services Administration), Son Tran, Broadcasting Board of Governors, Elizabeth Raley (CivicActions), Chris Cairns and Robert L. Read (18F).

It was an excellent discussion that went a little beyond the basics, and there were a number of questions we didn't get to, but overall it's a helpful introduction that includes some great panelist anecdotes. If you missed the live discussion, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQxd96-4vqs">watch the video</a> and post follow-up questions to the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/AGL-Live-Agile-Government-101-6642487.S.5976844160324354052?trk=groups_most_recent-0-b-ttl&amp;goback=%2Egmr_6642487">AGL LinkedIn group</a>.
