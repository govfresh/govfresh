The General Services Administration <a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/gsablog/2015/04/13/gsa-turns-the-lights-on-at-acquisition-gov/">announced</a> a new re-design of <a href="http://acquisitions.gov">acquisition.gov</a>, the official website for the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

Here are my thoughts and observations: 

<strong>Redirects don't work.</strong> One of the first issues you typically address on a site redesign is the 301 redirect meaning that if a link name has changed, you redirect it to a corresponding new page. That way when someone searches or clicks on an old link, they are redirected to a new page.

As you can see, this is not the case for the old FAR URL, <a href="http://www.acquisition.gov/far">acquisition.gov/far</a>:

<strong>It's open source.</strong> Don't quote me on this, but I believe the original was developed in Microsoft's Active Server Pages. The new site is built on the open source content management system Drupal which, of course, is a positive direction towards federal government open source adoption. 

<strong>Audience.</strong> There's probably not much you can do to avoid the alphabet soup of federal government acronyms, but the site doesn't make it helpful for those new to federal procurement. There are a few helpful videos, but it doesn't do anything to make the FAR appear more accessible. It's very link-heavy without access to entry-level information or smooth transition to extended resources.

<strong>Not mobile-friendly.</strong> I can't tell if the code is buggy or if it's just not responsive at all, but it doesn't adapt at all on my phone or browser. There appears to be a horizontal scroll bug, so I assume that is the problem.

<strong>Search could be better.</strong> To me, this is the most important aspect of a FAR website, and this is where it falls short. While there is now a downloadable HTML version (which, in its current form, isn't very useful), there still isn't a seamless way to search and view text in the FAR. Even the font-resizing tool doesn't resize the actual FAR text.

<strong>Frames.</strong> Perhaps the primary reason for the limited user-friendliness is that the FAR pages are simply a frame-based version of the old FAR website, which used to be at <a href="http://www.acquisition.gov/far">acquisition.gov/far</a>. I'm frankly surprised that this was an acceptable solution to making acquisition.gov a better tool.

I wouldn't call this a re-design of acquisitions.gov, but more of a new template and technology. The core mission of the site, making the actual FAR more accessible, still has a long way to go.
