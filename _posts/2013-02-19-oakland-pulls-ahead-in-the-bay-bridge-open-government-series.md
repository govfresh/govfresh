It hasn't garnered the accolades San Francisco historically has, but it appears Oakland is starting to pull ahead in the Bay Bridge Open Government Series.

The active <a href="http://openoakland.org/">OpenOakland</a> team, with its <a href="http://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/">weekly meetup</a>, first <a href="http://openoakland.org/civicmeet-oakland-code-for-america-welcome-reception-at-city-hall/">CivicMeet Oakland</a>, community-driven <a href="http://data.openoakland.org/">open data platform</a>, <a href="http://citycampoak.org/">CityCamp Oakland</a>, <a href="http://oaklandwiki.org/">Oakland Wiki</a> and upcoming <a href="http://openoakland.github.com/open-data-day-2013/">Open Data Day Oakland</a> hackathon, is quickly becoming the civic hacker model for all other metropolitan areas.

The city is also showing signs of open government adoption, including its willingness to collaborate with OpenOakland, launching a new <a href="https://data.oaklandnet.com/">official open data portal</a> and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2013-partners/oakland/">hosting Code for America fellows this year</a>.

While San Francisco has adopted some of the above, with the exception of the CfA fellows program, much of its open government achievements were accomplished during the Gavin Newsom years. And, surprisingly, an organized civic hacker community has yet to emerge.

In recognition of OpenOakland's work, Oakland's city council recently passed the <a href="https://twitter.com/spjika/status/304079082906341379/photo/1">following resolution</a>:

<blockquote>RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING FEBRUARY 23, 2013 AS OPEN DATA DAY IN OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA
