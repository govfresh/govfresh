Excellent <a href="http://wearefuturegov.com/2011/08/22/a-vision-for-opengov-speaking-at-tedx/">TEDxLondonBusinessSchool talk on open government</a> by <a href="http://wearefuturegov.com">FutureGov</a> founder <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/DominicCampbell">Dominic Campbell</a>.

Quotable:

<blockquote>"We're at a point now, where you're either with us or against us. Are you just trying to nibble away at government and make it slightly more efficient, shine the windows on the town hall, make the odd bit of savings or are we actually going to transform government into something entirely different? "</blockquote>
