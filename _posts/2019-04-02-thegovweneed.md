<p>Two years ago, I had an idea for a podcast that focused on the whole of government, and how big thinkers are re-imagining and changing how civil society operates along the civic spectrum.</p>

<p>The idea, which I named <a href="https://govfresh.github.io/thegovweneed/index.html">The Government We Need</a>, has been sitting on the back burner since.</p>

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>While I went so far as to create brand elements, social media accounts, project management and strategic documentation on this, I just haven't found the time or energy to execute in a way that would do it justice.</p>

<p>Normally, with ideas that I prototype and don't act on, I delete and move on, archiving them as just another experiment in learning and creative processing. For some reason, I think this one has the potential to impact the conversation around government change in a creative, interesting format.</p>
