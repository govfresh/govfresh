<p>The DotGov Program, which <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/gov.html">administers .gov top-level domain</a> assignments to official U.S. government entities, now offers the service for free. Price for access to an official .gov domain previously was $400 per year, which many local governments deemed too expensive and prohibitive to obtain.</p>

So, in order to remove unnecessary barriers and reduce the credibility of malicious impersonation attempts, .<strong>gov domains will be available at no cost for qualifying organizations beginning today</strong>.</p></blockquote>
