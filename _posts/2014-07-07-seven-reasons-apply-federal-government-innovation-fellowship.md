If you're interested in working for the federal government with an agency that doesn't have the institutional legacy of entrenched bureaucracy and truly gets design and open source innovation, and has a direct impact on American consumers, the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/jobs/technology-innovation-fellows">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has just the opportunity for you</a>.

CFPB is looking for the best and brightest designers, developers and security and data experts for its 2015 class of <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/jobs/technology-innovation-fellows">technology and innovation fellows</a>.

Here are seven reasons why you should apply:

<ol>
	<li>CFPB openly supports a distributed work environment for its fellows. After an initial onsite immersion, fellows can work from wherever they please (but still get to visit DC once a quarter).</li>
	<li>It's a two-year program, which means you have enough time to have a sustainable impact.</li>
	<li>You're required to use the latest open source technologies, such as GitHub and WordPress, because they actually use these on a day-to-day basis.</li>
	<li>They are committed to open source and even have an <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/source-code-policy/blob/gh-pages/cfpb-source-code-policy.txt">established policy</a> for that.</li>
	<li>This line in the FAQs: "If you like to learn new tools and technologies and pick them up very easily, we want to hear from you."</li>
	<li>Their approach to design is probably better than anyone else in the federal government and they actually have a <a href="https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/">design manual</a> that every agency should mimic (related: this "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X078IIOqZGE">Design at CFPB</a>" video).
</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=10690378&amp;authType=OUT_OF_NETWORK&amp;authToken=2Xp4&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah2&amp;trkInfo=tarId%3A1404750209401%2Ctas%3Amichael%20by%2Cidx%3A1-1-1">Mike Byrne</a> works there!</li>
</ol>
