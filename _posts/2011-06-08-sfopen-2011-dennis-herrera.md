<h3>Committed to the Open Government Pledge for San Francisco?</h3>

Yes. 

<h3>Open government statement</h3>

<blockquote>"Open Government – transparency, participation and collaboration – is essential to San Francisco’s success as a modern city. Transparency ensures honesty and trust in our system of governance; participation recognizes the essential nature of our democracy and incredible creative input of our residents; and collaboration means effective governance – sharing resources, ideas and best practices with federal, state and other local agencies and the private sector to ensure San Francisco is a city that works."</blockquote>
