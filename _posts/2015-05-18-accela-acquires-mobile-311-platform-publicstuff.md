Government-solutions provider Accela announced it has acquired
the New York City-based 311 platform startup <a href="http://govfresh.com/2013/04/publicstuff/">PublicStuff</a>.

The service allows citizens to report non-emergency requests, such as potholes and graffiti, via their mobile devices, which are then serviced through a back-end, enterprise customer relationship management system.

According to an Accela press release, more than 150 municipalities subscribe to the service.

“With this acquisition of PublicStuff, we’re closer to giving residents access to City Hall from the convenience of their mobile phones," said Accela CEO Maury Blackman in a press release. "We’re delivering on our mission to empower citizens to more easily interact with government services and to help save our government partners time and money through technology."

Accela recently received $143.5 million in new financing to expand its government solutions offering. According to the company, it has more than 2,000 government agency customers.

Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
