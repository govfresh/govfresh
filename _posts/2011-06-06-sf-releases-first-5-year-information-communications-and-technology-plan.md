San Francisco's Committee on Information Technology (COIT) has released its first Information, Communications and Technology Plan that "focuses the City’s resources on the issues of security, access, infrastructure, communication and efficient computing."

COIT is comprised of the Mayor, President of the Board of Supervisors, Controller, City Administrator, Chief Information Officer and eight city department heads.

Acting Chief Information Officer Jon Walton writes in the introduction:

<blockquote>The City enjoys an abundance of ICT talent, organizations and political support. However, we face twin challenges of budget shortfalls and aging ICT systems. The City cannot afford to continue performing its operations andmaintenance in departmental silos as this will only magnify the challenges that face us. Getting the most out of ICTfor the City means making tough transformational decisions, proactively managing ICT projects, and leveraging thebenefits of shared services and cross-departmental partnerships.</blockquote>
