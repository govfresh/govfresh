Today, I had the opportunity to attend <a href="http://codeforoakland.org">Code for Oakland</a> 2012 and, as always with events like this, walked away inspired by the work of good friends and the enthusiasm of citizens and public servants wanting to do more for their communities. Big kudos to all involved engaging, organizing and sponsoring a great event in a great city.
