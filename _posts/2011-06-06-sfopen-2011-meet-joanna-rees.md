<h3>Committed to the Open Government Pledge for San Francisco?</h3>

Yes. 

<h3>Open government statement</h3>

<blockquote>"An effective government must clearly communicate its goals and actions. I support an open and transparent government that gives people with good ideas the tools they need to actively participate in the dialogue and move our city forward. I will create an environment at City Hall that requires transparency and encourages innovation and new ideas."</blockquote>
