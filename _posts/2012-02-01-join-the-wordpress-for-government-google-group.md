As I mentioned in my <a href="http://govfresh.com/2012/01/whats-your-2012-civic-commitment/">2012 civic commitment</a> post, I’m focused on helping drastically lower the cost, de-mystify the technology and build better websites for local government.

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/govfreshwp?hl=en">This is the first step.</a>

Here at GovFresh we love open source software, especially <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. While Drupal gets much of the press when it comes to open source and government, many municipalities and elected officials are implementing WordPress because of its cost (free), portability, accessible theming and plugin options and excellent content management system.

We're just getting started, but if you're a government web developer, WordPress developer or theme designer or interested in learning more about it, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/govfreshwp?hl=en">join the GovFresh WP (WordPress &amp; Government) Google Group</a>.

Let's work together and help one another revolutionize how government builds websites.
