Lately, I've focused much of my time on <a href="https://proudcity.com/pilot/">ProudCity</a> and haven't had the time to write much here, but I wanted to share a great opportunity for cities looking for a digital upgrade.

We've launched our <a href="https://proudcity.com/pilot/">ProudCity Pilot Program</a> that gives cities a chance to collaborate closely with ProudCity and test and give feedback on new product developments.

Cities receive one year of free ProudCity services, and we work directly with them to assess their current digital systems, how they can be optimized, and then help them quickly onboard to the platform.

It’s an excellent opportunity for cities to reboot their digital service offering and for ProudCity to learn firsthand the needs of municipal governments and help them modernize their online offerings.

A great example of this is our first pilot city, <a href="https://proudcity.com/case-studies/west-carrollton-ohio/">West Carrollton, Ohio</a>, and how they moved a seven year-old website to ProudCity in 60 days. Read about West Carrollton’s pilot experience in <a href="https://proudcity.com/case-studies/west-carrollton-ohio/"><i>Government Technology</i></a>.

To qualify for the program, cities must launch:
<ul>
	<li>A public city BETA (test) website within 30 days</li>
	<li>An official LIVE city website within 60 days</li>
</ul>
Application deadline is Wednesday, March 30, 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, and our next pilot city will be announced Friday, April 1.
