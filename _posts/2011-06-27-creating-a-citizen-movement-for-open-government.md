How do you get techies, govies, and citizens to identify,  collaborate, and start creating solutions for your local government?  Host a CityCamp.

It's easier than you think. The first CityCamp Raleigh started as a  conversation about citizen engagement, but we realized that we could do  more than just talk about it. A dozen people came together over 12 weeks  to make CityCamp Raleigh a reality. Over 225 people attended three days  of collaboration, sharing, and encouraging openness--focusing on <a title="improving access to data and solutions for local government" href="http://opensource.com/government/11/6/citycamp-organizing-unconference-transparent-city-government" target="_blank">improving access to data and solutions for local government</a>.

Three themes emerged over the weekend, all twists on <a title="Keeping an open mind on open government" href="http://opensource.com/government/11/6/keeping-open-mind-open-government" target="_blank">open government</a>:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Create a citizen movement" href="http://opensource.com/government/11/6/citycamp-raleigh-creating-citizen-movement-open-government#citizenmovement" target="_self">Create a citizen movement</a></li>
	<li><a title="Eliminate email for feedback" href="http://opensource.com/government/11/6/citycamp-raleigh-creating-citizen-movement-open-government#email" target="_self">Eliminate email for feedback</a></li>
	<li><a title="Create opportunities for citizens to collaborate with city staff" href="http://opensource.com/government/11/6/citycamp-raleigh-creating-citizen-movement-open-government#collaborate" target="_self">Create opportunities for citizens to collaborate with city staff</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="citizen_movement"></a>Create a citizen movement</h2>
The following conversation took place on the first day of CityCamp  Raleigh (over Twitter), and it resonated with me because events like  CityCamp can influence citizen participation in government. The comments  were both critical and encouraging:
<blockquote><a title="@RogerTheGeek (Roger Austin)" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/RogerTheGeek/status/77060295750729728" target="_blank">@RogerTheGeek (Roger Austin)</a> - Why I am not enthusiastic about #ccral as a geek citizen? The  political landscape changes every election. All past work is flushed.  Bummer

<a title="@adrielhampton (Adriel Hampton)" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/adrielhampton/status/77067717970116608%20" target="_blank">@adrielhampton (Adriel Hampton)</a> - @RogerTheGeek You have to create a powerful movement that is community owned. That's how you beat political cycles. #ccRal</blockquote>
Adriel is spot on. He also highlights one of the reasons why CityCamp  Raleigh was successful—it was citizen-led. Passionate citizens came  together to plan and execute this event. Now that it's over, it's  transitioning into a movement. And it's still citizen-led.

We were fortunate to have City Councilor Bonner Gaylord co-chair the  planning committee and Jonathan Minter, City of Raleigh IT director, on  the planning committee. But we also had citizens with passion about  making CityCamp more than a conversation. If this was run by a city  department, I don't think we would have pulled the three-day event off  with less than 12 weeks of planning. The red tape would have been  impossible to cut through.

Creating a citizen movement doesn't happen overnight. The potential  CityCamp Raleigh has to provide leadership and advocacy in the open  source, open data, and technology space is immeasurable. The future  opportunities of this citizen-led movement will make a big impact on the  direction the city takes with open data and could redefine citizen  participation.
<h2><a name="email"></a>Eliminate email for feedback</h2>
Kevin Curry posted an observation that highlights my next theme, how  to get feedback on city initiatives. And it involves ditching your inbox  to improve transparency.
<blockquote>Interesting: both panels have raised the idea of <a title="abandoning email" href="http://twitter.com/#%21/kmcurry/status/76727827084488704" target="_blank">abandoning email</a> as a mode of interacting with local gov #ccRAL</blockquote>
Government isn't the only place where email has become a burden. And <a title="#noemail: Are technology's early adopters abandoning their email?" href="http://opensource.com/life/11/5/noemail-why-are-some-technologys-early-adopters-abandoning-their-email" target="_blank">some people have already considered (or attempted) giving up their email</a>.  How are they able to do that? By taking advantage of different social  platforms and tools to communicate with the people they need to reach.  By choosing <a title="Avoid the tool trap when building communities" href="http://opensource.com/business/10/11/avoid-tool-trap-when-building-communities" target="_blank">the right tool for the right job</a> , and making sure everyone you want to know can still find you,  communication is not interrupted--the theory is that it is made more  efficient.

A few years ago, I had an opportunity to lead a group of citizens  reviewing the draft of Raleigh's 2030 Comprehensive Plan. (This is a  planning document that outlines the growth areas and objectives for the  city over the next 20 years.) For this review, the planning department  choose to use on online portal called Limehouse to collect comments and  feedback.

While it's not open source, it was better than the  alternative—emailing city staff. Email is not transparent. Sure, we can  request all the comments collected be posted on a website somewhere, but  that's not direct communication, nor is it timely. Someone has to  compile and copy all that data. So we liked the direction taken with the  use of the portal.

<a title="Limehouse" href="http://raleigh-consult.limehouse.com/portal" target="_blank">Limehouse</a> was a central place where you could comment on individual paragraphs of  the plan. Not only could you submit your comments, but you could see  what others were saying. You could agree or disagree with those comments  as well.

Using email to share feedback with local government only goes so far.  It's a great tool for communication, but not so much for collaboration,  sharing, and transparency. Avoiding email for feedback might actually  help city employees do their jobs. Instead of being stuck at their desk  answering emails, they can use their skills more efficiently.
<h2><a name="collaborate"></a>Create opportunities for citizens to collaborate with city staff</h2>
Another positive result was the engagement and collaboration between  city staff and citizens. The dialog between city employees and citizens  was happening before CityCamp, but on a much smaller scale--usually  one-on-one and dependent on very specific issues. People usually wait  until they have a problem to make contact (examples include technical  support or surveys). The collaborative atmosphere at CityCamp Raleigh  allowed the dialog to flourish between these stakeholders without the  added burden of conflict, and without having to wait for an issue to  occur.

In one session, the editor from a local online publication was explaining <a title="how they mapped out tornado damage" href="http://www.raleighpublicrecord.org/news/2011/04/22/mapping-raleigh-tornado-damage/" target="_blank">how they mapped out tornado damage</a> from mid-April using city-provided data. What amazed me was that the  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) manager from Raleigh, Colleen  Sharpe, was sitting just a few seats down, and was able to provide  immediate additional insight.

Colleen told us how the inspectors  collected the data and how the GIS department was able to prepare the  entire data set so it was usable and open. The GIS department made the  disaster data available to the public very, very quickly--less than 48  hours after meeting the 72-hour Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) deadlines for damage assessment. This quick turnaround is now a  model for other municipalities who need to collect and publish data in  this type of disaster scenario.
<h2>What's next?</h2>
The future for CityCamp Raleigh looks bright. The planning committee  is already exploring an approach that would lead to an event in 2012. In  the meantime, there are a few things that are critical for continued  success:
<ol>
	<li><a title="Solving city problems the open source way" href="http://opensource.com/government/11/6/solving-city-problems-open-source-way" target="_blank">Follow-up with the teams</a> who presented ideas. See where they are, what they're doing, and if their proposal is making any progress.</li>
	<li>Host monthly meet-ups with speakers and different topics. We want to  keep the momentum going and meeting on a regular basis is one way to  achieve that.</li>
	<li><a title="Advocate for an open source directive" href="http://citycampral.org/2011/06/support-raleighs-open-source-directive/" target="_blank">Advocate for an open source directive</a>—ours is currently before our local city council.</li>
</ol>
CityCamp Raleigh was a huge success. Not only was it a fulfilling  experience for me personally, but a great team of people came together  to get work done, and share a positive experience with government  planning. We all had something in common—we want our city to be a better  place to live. And we want other people to share that passion.

If you want to be a part of a movement that has tangible results over  the course of a weekend, host a CityCamp. Your local government leaders  will thank you for it—especially if you invite them along for the ride.
