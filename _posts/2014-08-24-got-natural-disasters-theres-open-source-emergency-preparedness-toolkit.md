If you live in the San Francisco Bay Area and woke up at to a 6.1 earthquake at 3:30 a.m. this morning, now would be a good time for citizens and local governments everywhere to take a look at <a href="http://toolkit.sf72.org">City72 Toolkit</a>.

The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management recently partnered with design firm IDEO to create the <a href="http://toolkit.sf72.org/">City72 Toolkit</a>, an open source "emergency preparedness platform that promotes community resilience and connection." 

The toolkit is now freely-available to cities everywhere to re-purpose and customize to provide information to their own residents.

SFDEM's Kristin Hogan Schildwachter shares the inspiration for City72 and <a href="http://toolkit.sf72.org/setup/">how other cities can easily create their own</a>.

<h3>What is City72 Toolkit?</h3>

City72 is an open source emergency preparedness platform that promotes community resilience and connection. This toolkit is designed specifically for emergency preparedness organizations and provides the information and resources to create a customized City72 site for any city or region.

It includes: 

<ul>
	<li>how to create localized content;</li>
	<li>access to the code to build and install your City72 website; and</li>
	<li>tips for how to manage and promote your site</li>
</ul>

<h3>How did it come about?</h3>

Until 2009, in San Francisco we were following the prescriptive “Make a Plan. Get a Kit. Be Informed.” emergency preparedness messages, which we modeled after FEMA’s national preparedness campaign "Ready." And what we found was that we were only reaching a small percentage of the general public: the already prepared.

So, in 2008 our deputy director of emergency services, Rob Dudgeon, kicked off an initiative to redefine how we messaged and packaged emergency preparedness with the mantra “If we keep promoting emergency preparedness this way, we’re only going to get who we’ve already gotten prepared.”

We leveraged a lot of research based on social science data and also the findings from a major project assessing state of Bay Area Preparedness (the Bay Area Urban Area Security Initiative) Community Preparedness Project) to develop a communications strategy to redefine how we messaged emergency preparedness.

This strategy, the DEM Preparedness Movement Communications Strategy, became the basis upon which we communicated about emergency preparedness and informed our in-person and social media communications, but it was not reflected in our emergency preparedness website (at the time): <a href="http://www.72hours.org">www.72hours.org</a>. We knew we needed to rebrand this website to align with our communications strategy, so we secured some grant funding and issued a request for proposal to redesign <a href="http://www.72hours.org">www.72hours.org</a>. 

IDEO bid on the RFP, and through a competitive process they were the selected vendor. From there, IDEO and its human-centered design approach helped us to manifest our vision resulting in <a href="http://www.sf72.org">www.sf72.org</a>.

Meanwhile, we wanted to share our findings, experience and redefinition of preparedness messaging within the emergency management community at large. So, we wrote within the terms our final deliverable that it the web site be open source, so any other city could have access to SF72.org’s design and content.  

To make this a more tangible possibility, we worked with IDEO to create the City72 toolkit.

<h3>How can others use it?</h3>

The City72 Toolkit provides cities ready to create their own version of City72.org step by step instructions for how to set up their site. It’s recommended to have some technical support from a web developer (or an internal city resource or contractor).

<h3>Who's using it and how?</h3>

Right now, Johnson County, Kansas is in the process of creating its own version of City72 (to be called JoCo72.org). We have had conversations with other city offices of emergency management about City72, and we are hoping they may be the next generation of City72 sites.

<h3>How can others connect with you to learn more?</h3>

We would be thrilled to talk with anyone interested in City72.org. We can be reached via email at <a href="mailto:sf72@sfgov.org">sf72@sfgov.org</a> and/or Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/@sf72org">@sf72org</a>.
