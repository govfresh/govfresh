Last Week Tonight's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-XlyB_QQYs">feature segment</a> focused on antiquated 911 technology, particularly its inability to leverage mobile geolocation and effectively pinpoint a caller's whereabouts from his or her cellphone.

"911 losing valuable time simply because dispatchers have trouble determining your location is not unusual," says host John Oliver.

Fortunately, <a href="https://patronusapp.com/">there's an app for that</a>.

<a href="https://patronusapp.com/">Patronus</a> (formerly <a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2014/11/bluelight-theres-911-app/">Bluelight</a>) is a free, consumer-focused 911 app (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.fourtaps.bluelight&amp;referrer=website">Android</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bluelight-campus-safety-emergency/id606865071?mt=8">Apple</a>) that routes emergency calls to the closest dispatcher. Current features provide caller name and location (address and GPS latitude/longitude) and will immediately notify key personal contacts. Future features include date of birth, health conditions, emergency contacts, medications, real-time location and caller photograph.

According to Oliver, more than 240 million 911 calls are made each year, with up to 80 percent coming from wireless devices. 

He cites a Federal Communications report that "location accuracy improvements ... could save approximately 10,120 lives annually."
