NationBuilder Vice President of Community Adriel Hampton introduces the company's newest offering, <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/government">NationBuilder Government</a>.

<h2>Give us the 140-character elevator pitch.</h2>

<a href="http://nationbuilder.com/government">NationBuilder Government</a> is a unified web, communications and CRM database solution - <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/government_pricing">at less than $100 a month for most entities</a> (yes, really).

<h2>What problems does NationBuilder solve for government?</h2>

Governments of all sizes struggle with listening well to feedback from a growing number of communications channels. The challenge is to provide better customer service, and to do it cost effectively.

NationBuilder is a unified organizing platform that’s designed to improve the efficiency of communications and constituent/customer service staff.

<h2>What’s the story behind NationBuilder?</h2>

We’ve been around for a few years, but just launched our Government Edition earlier this month.

<a href="http://twitter.com/jgilliam">Jim Gilliam</a> founded the company after personally seeing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4WKle-GQwk">the power of people connected by the internet</a> as family and friends helped him get a double-lung transplant six years ago. I met Jim in 2009 <a href="http://www.nishachittal.com/nc/2009/06/meet-adriel-hampton-a-social-media-candidate-for-congress/">while I was running for Congress</a>, and joined NationBuilder as employee number 3 in May 2011.

Doing internet software for government better, more efficiently, is extremely important to me. There’s no reason to pay tens of thousands of dollars a year for these technologies.

<h2>Why should governments use your SaaS product and not an open source alternative?</h2>

Haha, I asked for that, right? So, open source projects have greatly helped to lower the costs of providing services over the web. We use a number of open source technologies including Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL and Liquid (a templating language that we’ve helped extend) - that allow companies like ours flourish at very low cost.

Instead of paying millions of dollars a year in licensing, we’re able to offer end-to-end solutions to cities and officeholders for just hundreds of dollars a year.

Open source products are never free for government - they require technical staff and consultants. We value transparent pricing and require it from our <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/partners">partners</a>, and provide a comprehensive, regularly updated solution that does not require a tech team to implement or maintain.

<h2>What are NationBuilder Government’s key features?</h2>

Interactive websites, email and text blasting, and constituent services tracking.

With NationBuilder, a government office can manage events, log and track issues, send email newsletters, and manage social media communications and an entire website all in one place.

<h2>What are the costs, pricing plans?</h2>

<a href="http://nationbuilder.com/government_pricing">Our pricing is based on the size of your database</a> - the smallest plans are $19 a month, a large city with 50,000 people on its email list would pay $499 a month with no limit on administrative users.
