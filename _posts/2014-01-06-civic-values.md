This morning I received the <a href="http://citizinvestor.com/">Citizinvestor</a> newsletter that included a well-thought out and strong values statement, important for any company, but especially those focused on serving the public sector.

I asked co-founder Jordan Raynor if I could re-publish it here, because much of it resonates with me and the work I do with GovFresh.

<blockquote>

<h2>Sharing our values</h2>

As we embark on this New Year, we wanted to take a moment to share something very personal with you.

We've recently taken the time to define what values we deem core to us as founders and as a company. We put these ideals through rigorous testing to ensure that they are indeed "core" to who we are as people and what we stand for as a company. You have likely seen many of these core values in the work Citizinvestor has done to date, and you will see them more deeply integrated into the Citizinvestor community in the future.

Without further adieu, here are our eight core values:

<h3>Live generously </h3>

We believe that generosity makes us better citizens. One who lives generously seeks to put others above themselves, freely giving their time, energy, and resources.

<h3>Love where you live </h3>

No one likes the guy who hates his hometown. Every city is broken, we know that. But we believe we are called to <em>love</em> where we live.

<h3>Be audacious </h3>

Dream bigger. Have a healthy disrespect for the status quo. Never fear failure.

<h3>Be disciplined </h3>

Vision without discipline is false hope. We love lists and focus, because we know that’s what makes us most free to do the best work.

<h3>Be self-aware </h3>

We know what we’re good at and what we suck at and we love that quality in others.

<h3>Transparency </h3>

Not lying is not enough. True transparency is in the best interest of everyone from customers, to employees, to partners.

<h3>Always be learning</h3>

Our love of learning spills into everything we do, from running constant experiments on our products, to A/B testing messaging, to always having a book in our hands.

<h3>For good, for profit</h3>

Profit and social impact are not mutually exclusive. We believe the best way to create real change is by creating new value in the marketplace.</blockquote>
