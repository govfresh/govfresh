San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee helped social coding platform <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> open the doors to its new 55,000 square foot headquarters in the city's SOMA district and, in tandem with the event, announced the city <a href="https://github.com/SFMOCI/openlaw">posted municipal code</a> on the site "to make it more accessible to our public."

From the <a href="http://sfmayor.org/index.aspx?page=846&amp;recordid=407&amp;returnURL=%2findex.aspx">release</a>:

<blockquote>Mayor Lee celebrated the opening of GitHub’s new office space as he announced that, for the first time, the City’s municipal code previously inaccessible in modern, programmer-friendly formats, will be available for anyone to view and for coders to build applications for online.  Making the municipal code available in this new format will make it easier for the public to navigate, understand and access the laws of San Francisco. The work of expanding access to the Municipal Code is the result of the efforts of many partners including American Legal Publishing, the OpenGov Foundation and GitHub.
