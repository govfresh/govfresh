This is the first time I've heard of Harvard-educated, professional wrestler look-alike and Braddock, Pennsylvania, mayor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fetterman_%28politician%29">John Fetterman</a>, featured in this episode of Hulu's "<a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/358111/a-day-in-the-life-john-fetterman">A Day In The Life</a>" series. <em>The Guardian</em> has called him "America's coolest mayor."

An incredible story about someone who probably could've done anything he wanted with his life, but instead decided to help rebuild a fading community.
