Oakland is looking for its next chief information officer to help position the city "at the forefront of American cities in its use of technology."

This is an extremely incredible opportunity for anyone who wants to get in on the ground floor in helping to transform the best city in the Bay Area (sorry San Francisco) and help foster a different kind of tech community both inside and outside government. For the government innovator who recognizes potential and is willing to invest in the long game, this is the job of a lifetime.
