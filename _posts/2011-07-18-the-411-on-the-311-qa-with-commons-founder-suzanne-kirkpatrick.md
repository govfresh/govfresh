We asked new 311 iPhone app <a href="http://govfresh.com/2011/06/new-mobile-app-commons-gets-creative-with-311/">Commons</a> co-founder Suzanne Kirkpatrick to share her thoughts on the new venture, 311 and trends in open government and Gov 2.0.

<h3>What inspired you to create Commons?</h3>

Sometimes moving to a new place gives you a fresh perspective on routine activities.  When I moved to NYC two years ago, I was surprised to see so many opportunities for neighborhood improvements near my home and school, and I was fascinated by NYC’s highly utilized 311 citizen reporting system. It was clear to me that NYC citizens care about improving their city, and that our City government is committed to listening to its citizens.   

But one thing that struck me about these analog and digital methods of reporting was that people were not reporting as a community -- they were reporting as individuals -- many people reporting in parallel without any shared awareness of one another’s activities. I then thought about designing a virtual social system that mimics the town hall meeting, where one person reports a problem or suggests an improvement, and 49 people “vote it up” (or in today’s terms, “like” it).  In today’s super connected world, we need a civic engagement system designed to support conversation among many people at once – and that is how I came up with the initial idea for Commons. 

Then I started thinking about the ways that I could connect to my new neighbors on the issues that I care about in our neighborhood, while on the go and in short bursts of focused time and energy, kind of like playing a game that is on-going over time and is something that you keep coming back to check and make a move.  Citizens are now used to having a digital presence that is de-coupled from our traditional notions of time and space.   

We have apps for citizen reporting of problems and complaints, like 311, SeeClickFix, FixMyStreet, and we have apps for sharing ideas for improvement, like Give A Minute (Local Projects), but I have this notion that these two worlds should be united in one as they seem like two sides of the same coin to me. I believe these two methods complement each other for a more complete civic engagement experience, and Commons aims to fulfill this vision. 

I’m a graduate student at ITP in NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts where I study interaction design, social software, and creative technology, a graduate researcher at the NYU Polytechnic Social Game Lab, spring intern at the NYC Mayor’s Office of Digital Coordination, and summer intern at Apple doing mobile user experience design, so I spend a lot of my time these days thinking about the intersection of these things. 

<h3>Aren't there enough 311 apps out there? How is Commons different?</h3>

We think Commons is one of the first in a new genre of “civic gaming”, a new approach to take citizen reporting social.  It’s a mobile, location-aware civic media app for urban communities that merges methods from traditional citizen reporting tools, with gaming mechanics and social voting. 

We hope that Commons will challenge the ways in which people think about their role in their communities, and in civic life in general. We hope it will transform the way that we as citizens engage with one another about the issues and places we share in common, and how we approach solving many of our own problems before government even gets involved.  

Commons provides a fun and constructive outlet for what is usually a frustrating experience of complaining about how broken your city is. And it goes way beyond reporting a pothole -- in fact, if you report a pothole in the game, you most likely won't win very many votes or kudos from your fellow neighbors because the game is designed to reward creative solutions and collaborative problem-solving.  We already have apps and websites for reporting potholes, like SeeClickFix and FixMyStreet in the UK, and like the <a href="http://thedailypothole.tumblr.com/">NYC Daily Pothole</a>, so we're not aiming to create another one.  

In our 3 playtests and on actual <a href="http://www.commonsthegame.com/?p=67">game day</a>, players said they really liked the positive social mechanics and voting aspect of the game, and how ‘community leaders’ seem to naturally emerge from the streams of activity. 

I don’t think people need attractive game mechanics to want to get involved in community service or town hall meetings, or any other sort of activity. On the other hand, elements of fun and competitive play introduce opportunities for serendipitous social interactions and competing to do good, which I love.  Doing activities with a thematic approach, or mission-centered perspective, helps keep people focused on the objective while having fun and making each individual’s input count.  

<h3>How do you hope to officially integrate Commons with municipality 311 centers?</h3>

Commons is a social platform that leverages crowdsourcing and location-based reporting techniques to improve city services and standards of living.  This civic engagement game is a way to connect citizens through the places they share in common, and to enable the government to fix the right problems, faster.  Through Commons, local government can 1) receive accurate and timely information, 2) identify priority areas, 3) efficiently allocate resources, and, ultimately, 4) demonstrate accountability to its citizens. 

Our goal is to build the next version of Commons as a cross-platform app on iOS, Android, (and possibly RIM in cities where it makes sense), with SMS integration and interoperability with <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a> technologies and read/write APIs for each city, so that 311 teams can integrate with Commons on the backend to pull its incoming data into their current operating centers and visualize trends from the data in realt-time. 

It is our hope that the data gathered from Commons will be valuable to city governments and municipality 311 centers, whose mission it is to enable citizen-centric, collaborative government and to expand civic engagement through new digital tools and real-time information services.   

<h3>What trends do you see occurring in open government / Gov 2.0 that you're most excited about?</h3>

Commons is definitely Gov 2.1+, combining the powers of serendipitous social interactions, mobile crowdsourcing, and game mechanics.   

Some of the rad trends in Gov 2.0 that I’m digging right now are: 1) cities supporting open data initiatives with read/write APIs, 2) mobile and location-based services, e.g. mobile banking, m-health, and m4d (mobile for development), 3) open standards for 311 services, like Open311, 4) citywide grassroots innovation contests, like NYCBigApps and DataSF App Contest, 5) open sharing of dev tools and code so we don’t all re-invent the same apps over again for each city, e.g. Code for America. I am also a huge supporter of bottom-up projects like <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a>, where citizens can collaboratively edit geographical data about their cities and neighborhoods and build useful and relevant maps from scratch.
