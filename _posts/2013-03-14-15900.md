Steve Reitano is conducting an open data research project as part of his academic work at Royal Roads University in Canada.

You can help him by <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/OpenDataSurvey" target="_blank">completing his open data survey</a>.

Here's part of the email I received from Steve:

<blockquote>My name is <a href="http://www.reitano.ca/" target="_blank">Steve Reitano</a>, and I am conducting a research project on the benefits of Open Data. I am writing to request your help with my project by asking you to complete my survey and to please share my request with your members.

To complete the survey, please go to the following URL: <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/OpenDataSurvey" target="_blank">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/OpenDataSurvey</a>

The purpose of this research project is to conduct a cost-benefits analysis that will identify the advantages of an Open Data Portal. It is a requirement for my Master’s Degree in Executive Management at Royal Roads University.  Additional information for my final research report will also be drawn from interviews and/or focus groups with Open Data experts from both government and the private sector. I will be sharing my findings from my research activities at the following URL: <a href="http://beautifuldata.ca/" target="_blank">http://beautifuldata.ca</a>

In addition to submitting my final report to Royal Roads University in partial fulfillment of my degree, I will also provide it to officials from the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat who are responsible for the Government of Canada’s Open Data portal (<a href="http://data.gc.ca/" target="_blank">data.gc.ca</a>). It is my hope that the report may help public organization’s make sound and informative decisions for extending their Open Data initiatives, and hopefully create a more cost effective, transparent, efficient and responsive government.</blockquote>
