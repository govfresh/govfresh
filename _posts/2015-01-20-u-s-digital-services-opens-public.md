After getting <a href="http://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2015/01/man-google-who-came-fix-federal-it-still-doesnt-have-his-own-website/102582/?oref=ng-HPriver">some grief</a> for not having a strong public presence, the U.S. Digital Service is beginning to open itself up with a new <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service">website</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMt0wH-twkE&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/usds">Twitter account</a>.

The new website highlights projects and team members and makes a compelling recruitment push for "designers and writers, engineers and product managers, researchers and procurement experts committed to untangling, rewiring, and redesigning our government."

From the website:

<blockquote>We understand the challenges, we're equipped with the right tools and resources, and every day a growing number of America's most talented people are joining hard-working public servants to make a difference. This community is the United States Digital Service. Together, we work with seasoned leaders across government to build world-class public services...and redefine public service for a new generation.
