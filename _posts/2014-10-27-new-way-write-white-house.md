The White House has officially released the write version of the "We the People" application programming interface that now allows developers to feed data back into the petition platform via third-party applications.

"Starting today, people can sign We the People petitions even when they’re not on WhiteHouse.gov," <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/10/23/new-we-people-write-api-and-what-it-means-you">writes</a> White House Director of New Media Technologies Leigh Heyman on the White House blog. "Now, users can also use third-party platforms, including other petitions services, or even their own websites or blogs. All of those signatures, once validated, will count towards a petition’s objective of meeting the 100,000-signature threshold needed for an official White House response."

According to Heyman, more than 16 million users have created and/or signed more than 360,000 petitions.
