Based on "extensive user research," the Federal Communications Commission has launched a beta version of fcc.gov that aims to make the site "more useful and accessible to FCC stakeholders."

The test site is located at <a href="https://prototype.fcc.gov/">prototype.fcc.gov</a>.

"Based on the additional feedback we receive during the website's extended Beta period, we intend to complete the switch to the new site fully later this fall with more details to be shared in the weeks ahead," <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/blog/your-feedback-building-better-fccgov">writes</a> FCC CIO David Bray announcing the beta.

Users can give feedback <a href="https://prototype.fcc.gov/eform/submit/feedback?destination=home">online</a> or via email at <a href="mailto:WebFeedback@fcc.gov">WebFeedback@fcc.gov</a>.
