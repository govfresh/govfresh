The U.S. Digital Service has soft-launched new <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/designstandards/">U.S. Web Design Standards</a> to "create consistency and beautiful user experiences across U.S. federal government websites."

The standards, similar to popular design frameworks like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>, include a style guide and downloadable code assets aimed at creating a unified, mobile-friendly citizen experience and making it easier for developers to deploy across all government websites.

With the new standards comes a slight modification to <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/#play3">play three</a> of the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov">U.S. Digital Services Playbook</a> ("Make it simple and intuitive") from "Create or use an existing, simple, and flexible design style guide for the service" to "Use a simple and flexible design style guide for the service. Use the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards">U.S. Web Design Standards</a> as a default."

Work on the standards began earlier this year with the pattern library and, as I've <a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2015/06/18f-starts-building-pattern-library-for-federal-government-websites/">mentioned before</a>, the federal government could realize millions of dollars in savings by simply re-purposing a unified framework instead of re-inventing the design wheel. Much like what Bootstrap and Foundation have done to exponentially  expedite development and go-to-market launches for countless startups and their products, so too could the U.S. Web Design Standards for federal government digital services.
