The U.S. Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2016/03/01/st-awards-11m-md-company">announced</a> it has awarded startup <a href="http://govready.com/">GovReady</a> a $1.1M certification and accreditation contract that will be critical to bringing an open source approach to security.

"GovReady will develop tools to help developers through the C&amp;A process and in doing so open the door for more secure, compliant and quality software systems," said DHS announcing the award.

“The C&amp;A process is essential, but, in its current state, unnecessarily difficult for small businesses to navigate,” said Homeland Open Security Technology Program Manager Dr. Dan Massey. “This project will help to even the playing field between large and small business by giving everyone an opportunity to provide software to the government.”
