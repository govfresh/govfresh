I've created a <a href="https://github.com/govfresh/feedback/issues">GitHubÂ repo</a> to maintain feedback, comments and ideas anyone has related to GovFresh.

I don't imagine it will get too much engagement, but believe this is an important way for organizations to maintain open discussions related to their operations.
