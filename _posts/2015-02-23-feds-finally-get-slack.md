In slightly surprising but welcomed news, the U.S. General Services Administration <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/02/18/8-new-federal-friendly-apps-and-services/">announced</a> approved terms of service agreements for the collaboration service <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a>.

From GSA:

<blockquote>The team communication platform, Slack, is a collaborative working area. The tool has an array of features – one-on-one messaging, private groups, persistent chat rooms, direct messaging – and is available as both an app and web platform. Users are able to search all of the content in a team’s Slack through one search box. This TOS agreement was negotiated by the Department of State.</blockquote>

Other newly-approved services include <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, <a href="http://stackexchange.com">StackExchange</a> and <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a>.
