<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This will be SpaceX’s final test flight for NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html">Commercial Crew Program</a> and will provide critical data on the performance of the Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon spacecraft, and ground systems, as well as in-orbit, docking, and landing operations. The test flight also will provide valuable data toward certification of SpaceX’s crew transportation system for regular flights carrying astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX currently is readying the hardware for the first space station crew rotational mission, which would happen after data from this test flight is reviewed for certification.</p></blockquote>
