<a href="http://www.hackingdemocracy.com/">Hacking Democracy</a>, released in 2007, documents the improprieties and lack of security around proprietary voting software vendor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Election_Solutions">Diebold Elections Systems</a>. It's incredible to see a group of citizens with little technical background become so passionate about a broken system that they delve deep into the intricacies of vote calculation, but also crack the code on an easily-penetrable software program.

Quotable:

<blockquote>"I think we, as election officials, need to be a little bit more demanding from the vendors as to the technical specifications of this equipment. The vendors are driving the process of voting technology in the United States. I would much rather at this point I think focus on allowing citizens to select technology that satisfies their needs."</blockquote>

I'm not a voting software expert, but after watching this, I want to learn more about the work of the <a href="http://www.osdv.org/">Open Source Digital Voting Foundation</a> and organizations like it.

Would love to hear feedback and thoughts on the subject from others who know more about this.
