<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VoS5ZdKuQ8">Great TEDxPhilly talk</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.codeforamerica.org%2F&amp;session_token=GY8-8RQgWzKEFY__001Mmi-zBRZ8MTMzMDgzNjEyOUAxMzMwNzQ5NzI5">Code for America</a> Founder and Executive Director Jen Pahlka. Really inspiring to see Jen articulate what's happening around city and local government beyond the tech talk people like me are so in the weeds on. I remember the old days <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAmsacoldJc&amp;feature=plcp&amp;context=C3894f14UDOEgsToPDskJGaIHUgD9VsDkQJGLRJNNf">when Jen humored me in 2009</a> and was one of the first people I interviewed using my trusty Flip on a tripod.

Quotable:

<blockquote>"We have a connection here that's broken in the larger scheme, but it works at the local level. We care, and it's important that we care about government, because government really is the way we do things collectively that we can't do individually ... The challenges of this century are too great to not be acting together."</blockquote>
