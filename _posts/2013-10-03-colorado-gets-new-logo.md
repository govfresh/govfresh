Colorado recently went through a design and brand identity process that culminated in a <a href="http://www.brandcolorado.gov/use-the-brand">new logo</a> and tagline. 

The tagline, "Itâ€™s our nature," says Colorado, symbolizes the state's "awe-inspiring scenery and life-loving people. It connects adventure with entrepreneurship, beauty with happiness and fresh air with creativity."

As with any final product design, there's <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3017119/rocky-start-colorado-adopts-a-new-state-logo-with-a-few-bumps">some drama</a> about the new look, but I like it. I'd love to see more governments incorporate a public design process like this.
