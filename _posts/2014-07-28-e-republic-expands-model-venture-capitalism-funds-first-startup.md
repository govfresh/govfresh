Government media and events company <a href="http://www.erepublic.com/">e.Republic</a> is expanding its business operations to include funding civic-focused startups, in hopes of leveraging its Rolodex of government officials to help serve as a channel for sales and marketing to those ventures it supports.

e.Republic's first beneficiary of the new strategy is <a href="http://archivesocial.com/">ArchiveSocial</a>, a social media archiving service that targets government agencies to help meet records retention policies. The company also makes the archives searchable to the public, as it has done for cities like <a href="http://nc.gov.archivesocial.com/">North Carolina</a> and <a href="http://austintexas.gov/page/social-media-archive">Austin</a>.

“Too often, new companies with great solutions to public-sector problems don’t have the resources, know-how and reach to truly scale,” e.Republic CEO Dennis McKenna said in a <a href="http://labs.erepublic.com/e-republic-ventures-chooses-archivesocial-newly-launched-gov-tech-accelerator-program/">press release</a> announcing the <a href="http://exitevent.com/archivesocial-raises-1m-from-strategic-california-govtech-investor-14718.asp">$1 million round of funding</a> that includes capital and marketing services. “We’re launching e.Republic Ventures to help companies with exciting public-sector solutions overcome these hurdles and win in the government market.”

According McKenna, on the <a href="http://labs.erepublic.com/">e.Republic Labs website</a>, <a href="http://www.erepublicventures.com/">e.Republic Ventures</a> is "an accelerator to assist select early-stage companies go to market with their game-changing solutions."

e.Republic was founded 30 years ago by McKenna and operates a number of media properties, including <a href="http://www.govtech.com/">Government Technology</a> and <a href="http://www.governing.com/">Governing</a>, as well as the research and consulting services operations <a href="http://www.govtech.com/cdg/">Center for Digital Government</a>. It also hosts numerous local events annually that connect government officials with sponsoring vendors.

The announcement of the direction corresponded with the appointment of Dustin Haisler as e.Republic chief innovation officer and head of e.Republic Labs. Haisler <a href="http://labs.erepublic.com/welcome-e-republic-labs/">joined eRepublic</a> in April.

Given that the challenge for most early-stage government and civic-focused startups is gaining credibility within government and then breaking through procurement red tape, e.Republic's new direction should prove useful and lucrative for those companies it supports.
