The question has again been asked, where are the women leaders and innovators in e-government, digital diplomacy, online politics, tech policy and related?

Answer: we're everywhere, from local government to global NGOs, although it's not always easy for journalists and other researchers to find this information. I've twice undertaken the task of listing women and it looks like it's that time again. This time, we want to crowd source our results beforehand to make sure we include as many women as possible.

In 2010, we published the "<a href="http://govfresh.com/2010/05/100-women-in-government-technology/">100+ Women in Government &amp; Technology</a>" list here at GovFresh and previously in 2008, I made a similar list at The Political Voices of Women, "<a href="http://politicsanew.com/2008/07/22/women-leading-in-technology-and-politics-or-policy/">Women Leading in Technology and Politics or Policy</a>." The area has only grown. Due to <a href="http://techpresident.com/news/23119/20-most-innovative-people-democracy-or-20-most-innovative-men">recent criticism</a> of only one woman being included in TechCrunch's list of "<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/03/the-20-most-innovative-people-in-democracy-2012/">The 20 Most Innovative People in Democracy 2012</a>" and backlash for the original Mother Jones list of "Men Who Stare at Votes" article including zero women (later updated and changed to include women in "<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/10/obama-campaign-tech-staff">Meet Obama's Digital Gurus</a>"), many of the people I interact with daily in this context - women and men - have argued that it's time for another more comprehensive list.

In the comments section below, please enter names, affiliations and TwitterIDs, links to bios, etc. for any women you recommend to add to our updated list. As a special nod to Veterans Day, please include any women who are serving or have served in the military. Thank you!
