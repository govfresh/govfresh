<a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/source-code-policy/issues/200">Favorite quote</a>:

<blockquote>Requiring software to be open source by default builds a culture that supports and amplifies the benefits of open source. When itâ€™s the default approach, developing in the open becomes second nature, rather than a separate process to follow for an arbitrary amount of projects. Measuring the amount of code released into the open as required by the 20% policy adds unnecessary overhead and burden to the process of developing open source software, and inhibits an open source-based workflow from becoming more widely adopted.</blockquote>
