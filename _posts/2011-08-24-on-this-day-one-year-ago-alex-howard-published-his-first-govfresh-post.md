On this day one year ago, Alex Howard published his <a href="http://gov20.govfresh.com/dustin-haisler-on-delivering-bettter-government-through-technology/">first GovFresh post</a>. Since then, he has written a total of <strong>302</strong> on his <a href="http://gov20.govfresh.com/">OpenGovFresh blog</a> (<a href="http://gov20.govfresh.com/feed">subscribe</a>).

Thank you Alex for your contributions and support of GovFresh, but also all the work you do for the entire open government community. There are many ideas, innovators, apps and events that don't get covered by mainstream media and, if they weren't covered by you, would never move beyond our community of Gov 2.0 enthusiasts. Blogging is powerful, and you do important work.

As I've said many times, Alex Howard is the "Hardest Working Man in Gov 2.0 Business."
