<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Government labs around the world are  finding ways to improve the decisions that public officials take. We are generating evidence that enables co-creation of public policies, we have an interdisciplinary perspective of problems and we prototype before implementing in order to reduce risk.</p><p>But we need to remember that our  efforts are part of something bigger. Labs are changing the paradigm of  thinking, designing and implementing public policies.</p><p>Perhaps it is time to move from labs learning from each other, to labs working together and executing  projects jointly?</p></blockquote>
