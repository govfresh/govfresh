<p>The U.S. Government Accountability Office <a href="https://blog.gao.gov/2019/06/27/is-the-cloud-saving-the-government-money/">published a bullish report</a> on the impact cloud services has had on federal government agency technology savings.</p>

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>Thirteen of 16 agencies reviewed indicated they saved $291 million  between 2014 and April 2019 from cloud services use. Because of a lack of reporting standards or guidance, "it is likely that agency-reported  cloud spending and savings figures were underreported," GAO <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-19-58?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=watchblog">wrote</a> in its analysis.</p>
