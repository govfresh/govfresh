The federal CIO Council’s Innovation Committee has published an open data prioritization <a href="https://cio.gov/wp-content/uploads/filebase/cio_document_library/Open%20Data%20Prioritization%20Toolkit_Workbook.xlsx">workbook</a> and <a href="https://cio.gov/wp-content/uploads/filebase/cio_document_library/Open%20Data%20Prioritization%20Toolkit_Summary.pdf">toolkit</a>, including a data inventory tracker and prioritization matrix, to help agencies best evaluate and prioritize data for release to the public.

"These tools enable Agencies to evaluate what data is most critical to share with external audiences (i.e. the public and/or other Agencies); and provide a structure for gathering feedback and balancing considerations such as impacts on individuals’ privacy or on national security," says the CIO Council in the toolkit summary.

The toolkit is an excellent resource for federal agencies, but all of the tabs in the workbook are applicable to state and local open data initiatives.

According to the CIO Council, input for the toolkit came from 500 employees across 20 agencies.
