North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and Chief Information Officer Chris Estes cut the tape on a new state innovation center Thursday that gives employees a chance to test-drive technology products before the state procures.

Called the <a href="http://icenter.nc.gov">iCenter</a>, the effort is part of McCrory's "try before you buy" policy established after an April 2013 state audit discovered actual costs of 84 previous projects were $356 million more than projected and ran 389 days past expected deadlines.
 
“Technology is the key to making state government more efficient,” McCrory said <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/newsroom/press-releases/20131010/governor-mccrory-opens-innovation-center">announcing</a> the opening. “The Innovation Center is a big step toward making state government user-friendly so that we can deliver more and improved services to citizens at a cost taxpayers can afford.”

“The Innovation Center is about connecting people and technology in a way that allows our state agencies to deliver more projects on time and on budget,” said Estes.
