Vocativ published its 2014 <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/interactive/culture/society/livability-index-2014/">Livability Index</a> of the 35 best cities for people 35 and under, and the best part of it is the <a href="http://www1.vocativ.com/content/themes/vocativ/interactives/201411livability/images/xcity-header.jpg.pagespeed.ic.e-ZGYGdJyp.webp">montage of city icons</a> they created for the piece.

I'm a big fan of cities creating a brand strategy and modern, friendly logos, much like <a href="http://govfresh.com/2013/10/colorado-gets-new-logo/">Colorado did</a>, and Vocativ did a great job highlighting the iconography of the featured cities.

My favorites are Reno, Kansas City and, of course, San Francisco.

What are yours?
