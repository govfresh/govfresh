Code for America is now accepting applications for its <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/geeks/accelerator-apply/">2014 Civic Startup Accelerator</a> program.

The program lasts four months and includes, according to CfA, training, mentorship, network, publicity, in-kind services, support and $25,000 in funding. Participating startups are expected to convene at CfA's San Francisco headquarters one week a month from July to October.

"Think about joining us as we work to catalyze the civic technology ecosystem â€” and to create a government by the people, for the people that works in the 21st century," <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/04/16/now-accepting-accelerator-applications/">said</a> Accelerator Manager Dharmishta Rood announcing the new round.
