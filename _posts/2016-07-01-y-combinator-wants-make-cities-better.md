Y Combinator is looking for a team of people to lead research on how to make cities better, and will use the findings to help determine how to invest in future ventures.

High-level issues the team will address include:

<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>What should a city optimize for?</li>
 	<li>How should we measure the effectiveness of a city (what are its KPIs)?</li>
 	<li>What values should (or should not) be embedded in a city's culture?</li>
 	<li>How can cities help more of their residents be happy and reach their potential?</li>
 	<li>How can we encourage a diverse range of people to live and work in the city?</li>
 	<li>How should citizens guide and participate in government?</li>
 	<li>How can we make sure a city is constantly evolving and always open to change?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
"The world is full of people who aren’t realizing their potential in large part because their cities don't provide the opportunities and living conditions necessary for success," writes Y Combinator's Adora Cheung <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/new-cities">announcing</a> the effort. "A high leverage way to improve our world is to unleash this massive potential by making better cities."

<a href="https://jobs.lever.co/ycr/03b226d0-148e-4ecd-a5f0-3e6074251eff">Application</a> deadline is July 30, 2016. You can share ideas directly via email to <a href="mailto:cities@ycr.org">cities@ycr.org</a>.
