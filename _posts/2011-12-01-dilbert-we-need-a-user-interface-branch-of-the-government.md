Dilbert creator Scott Adams has a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203716204577014262225551278.html">great editorial</a> in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> where he provides serious commentary on government and how civic-focused design would help modernize and better meet citizen expectations.

Quotables:

<blockquote>There's a reason changing our system of government is slow going. I like to think of the government as a big, complicated machine. We citizens are the users. What we've always lacked is a well-designed user interface. That's not a surprise when you consider the era in which our system was invented. Back then, the user interface for your mule involved a wooden club and language that would offend a pirate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Perhaps what we need is a fourth branch of government, smallish and economical, operating independently, with a mission to build and maintain a friendly user interface for citizens to manage their government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Imagine showing Jefferson the Internet. I think he'd immediately launch a start-up, design three apps and propose a new form of government that leverages social networks, all before lunch. </blockquote>
