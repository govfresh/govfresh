I'm a huge fan of government re-branding to modernize away from the antiquated look of the traditional seal, mostly because I believe it can play a huge role in citizen sentiment and how employees see themselves and their roles as public servants.

The City of Covington, Ky., takes a bold approach on this front with its new "Covingtonâ€™s Alive!" re-design.

Opinions in the <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_city_of_covington_by_landor.php#.VLSh12TF_0o">"Brand New" comments section</a> vary and, sure, the icon could be co-opted by clever designers, but it's great to see a city getting creative and bringing personality into the citizen experience.
