Great "<a href="http://spark.qualcomm.com/episode/connected-empowerment">Connected Empowerment</a>" video featuring San Francisco Chief Innovation Officer Jay Nath and civic action platform, <a href="https://neighborland.com/">Neighborland</a>.

Nath:

<blockquote>"Cities and government, in general, we're really factories of data, which is not our data. It rightfully belongs in the public domain."

"We see this digital space of empowering our citizens as the next generation of city government."</blockquote>
