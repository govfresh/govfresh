<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This isn’t just a slogan or a tagline. Instead, it’s a new approach  to food safety, one that recognizes and builds on the progress made in  the past, but also incorporates the use of new technologies that are  being used in society and business sectors all around us. These include  blockchain, sensor technology, the Internet of Things, and Artificial  Intelligence to create a more digital, traceable, and safer food system.  This new approach creates shared value for all stakeholders -- farmers,  food producers, regulators, consumers, and the planet.</p><p>...</p><p>That said, while technology is an important part of Smarter Food  Safety, it’s more than that. It’s about simpler, more effective and  modern approaches and processes. It’s about leadership and creativity.  It’s also about working within and outside of FDA to foster a food  safety culture that transcends borders between the public and private  sector.</p><p>...</p><p>In my view, today’s food system is amazing, but it does have one major Achilles heel: A lack of traceability and transparency.</p><p>...</p><p>When it comes to food traceability, some are stuck in a past in which  each segment in the food system is responsible for keeping track of  food, one step forward to identify where the food has gone and one step  back to identify the source. And it’s largely done on paper.  However,  with the emergence of new digital technologies, the proliferation of the  Internet of Things, and the continued advancement of sensor technology,  many believe the one-step forward and one-step back model of food  traceability is an outdated paradigm for the 21st Century. </p><p>...</p><p>When FSMA was conceived and launched, it brought people to the table, both public and private partners. A New Era of Smarter Food Safety is doing the same.  Now we plan to accelerate based on that foundation. How do we continue to modify and adapt? I foresee a more digital, data-driven, and transparent system that’s more precise and efficient.</p><p>...</p><p></p></blockquote>
