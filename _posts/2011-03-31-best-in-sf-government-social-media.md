The City of San Francisco over the last two years has aggressively embraced social media for marketing of government programs  and initiatives, citizen engagement, and two-way communications. An important task for the next mayor is not only to preserve the vibrant  ecosystem left by one of the U.S.'s most tech-savvy mayors, but to continue to advance government innovation in one of the world's most  tech-savvy cities. 

Let's take a quick look at some of San Francisco's crowning social media achievements, with an eye for growth:

<h2>Twitter</h2>

More than 50 <a href="http://twitter.com/SFCityAttorney/sf-officials" target="_blank">SF agencies and officials use Twitter for citizen engagement</a> and government marketing, not including political accounts. While none  approaches the 1.3  million followers of the former mayor, several of the accounts -  including those of citywide officeholders and popular city museums -  have several thousand followers each. The robust official Twitter  activity makes San Francisco one of the top municipalities in the world  for microblogging - it even takes service requests by tweet. The City  could take its Twitter use to the next level through improved  integration with official City websites and listening campaigns aimed at  identifying and responding to public concerns.

<h2>Contests and Video</h2>

SF's <a href="http://twitter.com/sfwater" target="_blank">Public Utilities Commission</a> created a positive stir around its goals of getting more residents to drink tap water and use reusable bottles with its "<a href="http://sfwater.org/detail.cfm/mc_id/18/msc_id/429/mto_id/733/c_id/4787" target="_blank">I Love SF Water</a>" YouTube campaign. Here's the winning entry:

SF  agencies have slowly embraced social media-fueled contests to generate  interest in their missions, and can take it up a notch through use of <a href="http://wiredtoshare.com/28818104" target="_blank">location-based apps</a> and creation of a universal template and aggregation site for official contests, similar to the U.S. GSA's <a href="http://challenge.gov/" target="_blank">Challenge.gov</a>.

The  former mayor was known for marathon YouTube videos, and one mayoral  candidate has proposed YouTube for submitting official public comments.  Including on-the-record video and text commenting is status quo  technology for the City's current public meeting webstreaming - it just  takes a leader willing to turn it on.

<h2>Facebook and 311</h2>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SF"></a>The  City's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SF">Facebook page</a> is a monster with more than a quarter millions  fans and  heavy interaction from fans of our beautiful metropolis. In a recent  addition, it includes on-site integration with SF 311, the City's  central agency responsible for taking and processing non-emergency  service requests. Creating a citywide social media best-practices  sharing forum and neighborhood-oriented trainings on multi-media access  to City services would leverage this Facebook clout to enhance other  social media efforts. The City might also consider allowing direct  access to expert staff through Facebook, similar to the efforts of the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/USGeologicalSurvey" target="_blank">U.S. Geographical Survey</a>.
