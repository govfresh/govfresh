Angie Quirarte is a behind-the-scenes hero for the state of California, leading on issues such as public sector workforce recruitment and retention, public data, creating a user-friendly government, improving  internal government processes and more. 

<h2>Let’s start with your personal story. How did you get to where you are today?</h2>

I grew up in humble beginnings and benefited from public services that I now work on to improve. 

The morning of September 11, 2001 I was at the Mexican border with my parents and two younger brothers. The uncertainty of the promised American Dream was worth the risk of leaving our lives and family behind. I never imagined myself working in government; but now that I am here, I realize that this is where you can honestly make a difference. 

I found my way to public service through the Capital Fellows Program as an<a href="http://csus.edu/calst/executive/index.html"> Executive Fellow</a> in 2013 after graduating from UCSB. As an Executive Fellow I was exposed to the highest levels of state government and worked on policy issues that strive to make government better. 

I didn’t think I’d stay in Sacramento after the fellowship, but the work and the mission made me fall in love with public service.

<h2>What is your role with the state of California, and what are you working on?</h2>

I was recently promoted as the new Assistant Secretary for Digital Engagement at the <a href="https://www.govops.ca.gov/">California Government Operations Agency</a> (GovOps). The Agency oversees the departments with functions that make government run, including technology, procurement, and the state civil service workforce. 

Within the Innovation and Accountability team at GovOps, I primarily work on policy and pilot programs that help create tomorrow’s government today by delivering better digital services, promoting the use of data to drive decision-making, and putting Californians and users at the center when designing technology projects meant to serve them.

Over the last few years I have focused on building and sustaining the open data program for the state and most recently helped coordinate the creation of the new Department of Tax and Fee Administration within a span of six weeks. 

My role is to identify pockets of innovation, pilot, implement and iterate! 

<h2>What’s the state of open data in California and what can we expect in the future?</h2>

Open data has slowly evolved at the state level. When I first started no one knew what open data was or why it was important. The world was fastly publishing data and I was working on steering the state in the same direction.

As I learned more about our departments and what other governments were doing, I realized that the important thing wasn’t how many datasets we could publish. What matters is the quality of the data and what one does with it. 

With this in mind we highly encourage and guide that departments that publish data onto data.ca.gov must also have civic engagement. This not only validates the value of the data, but also creates a collaborative environment where government can partner with others to solve common problems.

I hope to apply more of this for the future of open data in California. We have to democratize the access of data to the people affected by programs that aren’t using it to drive positive change.

<h2>Can you share more about NxtGov and why it matters?</h2>

<a href="https://nxtgov.org/">NxtGov</a> is a network of public servants and partners that know government has the potential to work better for its people. 

I founded NxtGov to bring pride into the profession of public service and recruit the next generation of government leaders. We provide a safe space for change agents that want to connect with others and provide professional development opportunities and community engagement events. We consult government agencies on things they should consider when recruiting and training the next generation workforce and actively coach students on the benefits of working for the state and recruit and onboard them into the state workforce. 

NxtGov matters because we break the silos of government and empower our members to become change agents in their departments. We make a difference by identifying key issues affecting our workforce now and bringing decision makers to the table to address the problems as the arise. 

<h2>Can you share more about the Eureka Institute and why it matters?</h2>

The Eureka Institute is a hub of the Innovation and Accountability team within GovOps. 

We established the <a href="https://www.govops.ca.gov/eureka-institute/">Eureka Institute</a> to make sure that government has a space to constantly innovate. Our focus lies on innovating government by developing programs, pilots, training and tools that develop our people, improve our processes, and leverage our technology to drive better program outcomes. 

Within Eureka we have the <a href="http://calhr.ca.gov/Training/Pages/statewide-leadership-development.aspx">CA Statewide Leadership Academy</a>, the <a href="https://www.govops.ca.gov/eureka/california-lean-academy/">CA Lean Academy</a>, and <a href="https://www.govops.ca.gov/eureka/ca-open-data/">CalData</a> which includes the open data program. These programs are changing the way the departments operate and that matters because the Eureka Institute allows government to adapt to a changing world. 

While most people would think that innovation comes from fancy technology and robots, I’ve come to learn that innovation is just another word for adaptation. Government bureaucracies must adapt their business operations in a changing world so that people can work collaboratively and leverage tools to better prepare for the government of the future.  

<h2>Who are your government heroes?</h2>

I am surrounded by many individuals at all levels who inspire me on a daily basis. 

Working in public service you encounter people of all backgrounds, and I have a long list of people I’d love to recognize, but one of the most influential heroines is my boss and GovOps Agency Secretary Marybel Batjer. She was recently named as one of Governing’s <a href="http://www.governing.com/poy/gov-marybel-batjer.html">Public Official of the Year</a>, and she deserves the recognition. I’ve been fortunate to witness many leadership styles over the last few years, and she stands out for her kindness and ability to dive in. I strive to learn from her leadership and kind demeanor. Marybel constantly reminds us that we are here to serve the public.
