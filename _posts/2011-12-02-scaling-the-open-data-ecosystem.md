Open Knowledge Foundation co-founder Rufus Pollock <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2011/10/31/scaling-the-open-data-ecosystem/">discusses his ideas on scaling an open data ecosystem</a>.

Excerpt:

<blockquote>In developing this open data ecosystem there are three key things are needed: material, tools and people. This is a key point: open information without tools and communities to utilise it is not enough, after all, openness isn’t an end itself – open material has no value if it isn’t used. We need therefore to have widely available the capabilities for utilising open material, for processing, analysing and sharing it, especially on a large scale. Relevant tools need to be freely and openly available and the related infrastructure — after all tools need somewhere to run, and data needs somewhere to be stored — should be capable of effective deployment by distributed communities.</blockquote>
