Ines Mergel asks a great question about a government 2.0 icon emblematic of the potential local open government had in its nascent heyday way back two years ago:

<blockquote>"<a href="http://inesmergel.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/a-tale-of-the-social-media-one-way-street-city-of-manor-reverts-back-to-the-dark-ages/">What happened, Manor?</a>"</blockquote>

For those unfamiliar with Manor and its young gun superstar and former CIO Dustin Haisler, Manor was symbolic of the "small town startup" that could strategically leverage modern technology to better serve citizens and run more efficiently while still keeping IT costs to a minimum. Haisler leveraged QR codes, WordPress, Google Apps, engagement platforms and other experimental technologies that brought Manor into the digital 21st century.

Today, that Manor is gone.

Haisler eventually left for the real startup world, and it appears the baton was either not properly handed off or just dropped altogether.

I asked Haisler about this, and here's his reply via email:

<blockquote>I think this shows the need for a few things:

(1) Forming a social norm around innovation and experimentation in government, which requires significant measurement and reporting in order to combat the risk that comes along with a change in administration. 

(2) Government innovation programs should not be run solely from within City Hall. There should be controlling interests from community stakeholders (businesses, non-profits, academia, etc.)

(3) The need for education. Current and future leaders of government agencies need to be educated on the business value that comes from using participatory technologies within government. 

This presents a unique opportunity to reinvent civic innovation within Manor (where I still live) from a truly grassroots perspective driven from the community.</blockquote>

Design is inherently subjective, so it's difficult to argue whether the new site is prettier than the previous version, however, there are several non-aesthetic components now missing from Manor's previous "beta city" vision that should be standard in all new government websites:

<ul>
	<li>no integrated content management system (it appears they're now using Google Blogspot to post site updates, but these are separate from the site's primary pages)</li>
	<li>less prominent social media accounts (previously, Manor had a Facebook, Twitter and Flickr presence, but now only Facebook is accessible, albeit hidden)</li>
	<li>no commitment to open source (previous WordPress theme was developed and made freely available to any government)</li>
	<li>no site search</li>
	<li>no accessible email or online contact form</li>
	<li>no open data portal</li>
	<li>no open 311 reporting</li>
	<li>URLs no longer mapped to cityofmanor.org domain</li>
	<li>basic disregard of 508 compliance</li>
</ul>

I'm not familiar with Manor's current operations and technological leadership but, judging by its new website, I concur with Mergel that "they apparently went back in time and put up a horrific website in a design that reminds me of the early days of the Internet." (disclaimer: I helped set up and design the previous version)

Whatever the reason for the set-back, there's a lesson to be learned in how to better transition an IT environment developed by a tech-savvy CIO to leadership that appears to be less informed on today's technological standards.

Most importantly, it's seems there's an opportunity here for the Gov 2.0 community to come together and address how small towns manage IT sustainability and help those that are less tech-savvy better understand and implement strategic, experimental and open technologies.

How can we do this?
