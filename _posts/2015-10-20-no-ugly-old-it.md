"No ugly, old IT" jumped out at me when I first reviewed DataSF's strategic plan, "<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mqunsT9wXRt-mBbOmY3WcEJmsWSpMOISotZ1WHZ1_IU/edit?usp=sharing">Data in San Francisco: Meeting supply, spurring demand</a>," and it still sticks, mostly because someone inside government was so bold as to make this a priority and openly communicate it, and also because this should be a mantra for everyone building civic technology.

Whether the end-user is the resident, citizen or bureaucrat, let's build more civic technology that, as Google Product Lead Sandra Nam <a href="https://medium.com/google-design/designing-a-ux-for-learning-ebed4fa0a798#.4eero66yf">says</a>, is "something someone would want to do instead of just another stressful part of their day."<em> (HT <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/alex-schmoe/b2/97/597">Alex Schmoe</a>)</em>

Here's the full DataSF mission, vision, approach:
<ol>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Say no to perfection.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> We don’t have enough time for perfect. Something is better than nothing and you can always improve it as you learn more.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Fail early and often.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Failing is ok - not learning from a failure is not ok. Small experiments, failed or successful inform our next steps.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Plan for the future.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Create infrastructure and systems for future growth - but solve immediate problems and pain points along the way</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Use long division.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> If a problem seems too big, break it into manageable bits. There’s always a hook or a starting point to move something forward.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>No ugly, old IT.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> We leverage existing, modern, and light-weight tools and we want our designs to be beautiful, inviting but also a little fun.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Use storytelling and data.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> We must work to find the people in the data and tell their story. Data without people is just academic. </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Seek institutional homes.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Distribute, share and foster excellence. While we may incubate programs, ideas or projects, we ultimately need to find a full-time home.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Learn to infinity and listen with humility.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Continuously learn from ourselves and others and build on existing frameworks. “Not invented here” attitudes are strictly prohibited.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Start with problems, move to opportunities.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> We start with people's needs and problems but also use the chance to show them some cool, new stuff for the future.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>If we don’t start now, we’ll never get there.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> We don’t want to look back in five years and think “if we had just…”. Every shady street started with a row of saplings.</span></li>
</ol>
