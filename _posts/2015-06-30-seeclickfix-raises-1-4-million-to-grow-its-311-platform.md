<a href="http://seeclickfix.com">SeeClickFix</a> announced today it raised an additional $1.4 million in investment to expand its 311 offering aimed at making it easier for city residents to report non-emergency issues and allow governments to quickly respond and resolve these in an open and public manner.

Previous investors Omidyar Network and O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures contributed to the new round along with new investors New Elm Street Ventures, Connecticut Innovations and LaunchCapital.

According to the announcement, SeeClickFix has 25 employees with plans to double over the next year.

SeeClickFix was founded in 2008 and, in January 2011, <a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2011/01/seeclickfix-gets-1-5m-investment-from-omidyar-network-oreilly-alphatech-ventures/">received</a> its first major round of funding at $1.5 million.

“Our citizen and government users have the same goal—to resolve problems and improve neighborhoods," said SeeClickFix CEO Ben Berkowitz <a href="http://blog.seeclickfix.com/seeclickfix-raises-1.4-million-to-fuel-growth">announcing the new investment</a>. "This funding will allow SeeClickFix to accelerate development and adoption of the next generation of request management—improving communication and communities throughout the world.”

“The SeeClickFix platform has demonstrated significant, tangible social impact," said Omidyar Network's Stacy Donohue in the release. "The team has created a scalable, low-cost way to turn citizen concerns and frustration into participation and engagement while strengthening community bonds.”
