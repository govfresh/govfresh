I'm reading Bill Eggers' new book, "<a href="http://www.deliveringondigital.com/">Delivering on Digital: The Innovators and Technologies That Are Transforming Government</a>," and wanted to share that it's now <a href="http://www.rosettabooks.com/rosetta-print/delivering-on-digital">available</a> for purchase.

Accompanying the release is a great compilation of digital government "<a href="http://www.deliveringondigital.com/playbook/">playbooks</a>" on the book's website.

FCW has an <a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2016/06/06/bookshelf-eggers-digital.aspx">early review</a> and better synopsis than I can give at the moment.

Eggers, executive director of Deloitte’s Center for Government Innovation, is also the author of "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Solution-Revolution-Business-Government-Enterprises/dp/1422192199/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465511968&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Solution+Revolution">The Solution Revolution: How Government, Business, and Social Enterprises are Teaming up to Solve Society’s Biggest Problems</a>," "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Can-Put-Man-Moon-Government/dp/1422166368/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465511990&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=If+We+Can+Put+a+Man+on+the+Moon">If We Can Put a Man on the Moon: Getting Big Things Done in Government</a>," "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Governing-Network-Shape-Public-Sector/dp/0815731299/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465512013&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Governing+by+Network">Governing by Network: The New Shape of the Public Sector </a>," "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Public-Innovators-Playbook-Nurturing-Government/dp/0979061113/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465513176&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Public+Innovator%E2%80%99s+Playbook">The Public Innovator’s Playbook</a>" and "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Government-2-0-Technology-Education-Democracy/dp/0742541762/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465511811&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Government+2.0">Government 2.0: Using Technology to Improve Education, Cut Red Tape, Reduce Gridlock, and Enhance Democracy</a>."
