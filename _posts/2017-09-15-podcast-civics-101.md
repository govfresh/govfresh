I recently discovered the podcast <a href="https://www.civics101podcast.org/">Civics 101</a>, hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/verginger?lang=en">Virginia Prescott</a> and produced by New Hampshire Public Radio.

The episodes focus on a single topic or institution -- such as gerrymandering, lobbying, nuclear codes, National Secretary Council, Department of State -- and interviews an expert with each lasting about 15 minutes.

Many of the episodes are inspired by listener questions (<a href="https://www.civics101podcast.org/submit-a-civics-question/">submit yours here</a>).
