A recent Seth Godin <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/12/the-reason-productivity-improvements-dont-work.html">blog post</a> resonates with me and reflects how I've always approached GovFresh and will continue to do in 2012.

<blockquote>Until you quiet the resistance and commit to actually shipping things that matter, all the productivity tips in the world aren't going to make a real difference. And, it turns out, once you do make the commitment, the productivity tips aren't that needed. 

<em>You don't need a new plan for next year. You need a commitment.</em></blockquote>

In 2012, I'm committing GovFresh to helping change the way government works. That may be too simplistic or idealistic for some, but it works for me.

More specifically, I'll focus on helping drastically lower the cost, de-mystify the technology and build better Websites for local government agencies and officials (more on that soon). This will be an open source community effort, so please connect with me if you're interested.

For two reasons, I'm genuinely interested in what <em>specific</em> civic commitment(s) you're making in 2012:

<ul>
	<li>I want to follow up to make sure you're doing it.</li>
	<li>I want to make sure GovFresh is helping as much as it can.</li>
</ul>

Email me (luke@govfresh) or share yours in the comments.

So, what's your 2012 civic commitment?
