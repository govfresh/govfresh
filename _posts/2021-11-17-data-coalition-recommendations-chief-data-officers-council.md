In response to a Chief Data Officers Council [call for public feedback](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/14/2021-22267/office-of-shared-solutions-and-performance-improvement-osspi-chief-data-officers-council-cdo-request), the Data Coalition shared [its recommendations](https://www.datacoalition.org/12-recommendations-for-the-chief-data-officers-council/) on how the federal government can best leverage data.

"The success of CDOs in the federal government hinges on their ability to perform expected and critical tasks," said Data Foundation President Nicholas Hart in a [letter](http://www.datacoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CDO-RFI-2.pdf) to the CDO Council. "If they are successful, government data can be an asset, creating a robust data infrastructure that will serve a variety of purposes, including improving operational decision-making and evidence-based policymaking capabilities."

Recommendations, based on a Data Coalition [virtual public forum](https://www.datacoalition.org/event/forum-cdo-mission-and-vision-2021/) and Data Foundation [survey](https://www.datafoundation.org/cdo-insights-report-2021), include:

* CDOs should work with their agency CFO and OMB to increase CDO funding flexibilities and direct resources.
* CDOs should work with OMB to clarify responsibilities and expectations.
* Congress should remove the statutory sunset of the CDO Council.
* The CDO Council should work to create an ecosystem of data-literate and data-fluent workers.
* CDOs should emphasize their role as designated leaders to promote training and data fluency among staff of departments.
* The CDO Council should work with the OMB to ensure that forthcoming implementation guidance to agencies on data inventories prioritizes machine readability and interoperability.
* CDOs should focus on data sharing standards that facilitate interoperability, data linkage, and privacy.
* Publicly accessible data must be prioritized.
* CDOs can improve communication about how they demonstrate the value of using data.
* CDOs should conduct regular maturity assessments to accurately gauge existing data capacity and needs.
* The CDO Council should create a permanent data ethics working group to ensure the Data Ethics framework continuously meets emerging needs, to provide resources and guidance to agencies, and to partner with relevant professional associations for ongoing education and training on data ethics.
* The CDO Council should work with CIOs to facilitate the adoption of appropriate modernized technology.
