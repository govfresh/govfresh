Delaware is in the process of beginning a new <a href="http://delaware.gov">delaware.gov</a> redesign and is asking for the public's input in the form of a short <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kCEdcRwsy4RkCzoBPdhJNF6FQMRVwTsBqBQFYYPl1Z0/viewform">survey</a>.

From the delaware.gov <a href="http://spotlight.blogs.delaware.gov/2013/10/07/please-help-us-redesign-the-delaware-gov-web-portal/">blog</a>:

<blockquote>We’re reviewing other states’ web sites. We’re looking at private sector web sites. We’re looking at federal, county and municipal web sites. We’re drawing on our years of experience managing the existing delaware.gov and answering your questions. We’re reviewing data on what people have searched for on the state’s phone directory search tool.
</blockquote>

Whether you live in Delaware or not, it's a great opportunity to influence the design and development strategy of one state's website. That doesn't happen too often.
