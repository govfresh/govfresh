A new report from the Knight Foundation, “<a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/media/uploads/publication_pdfs/knight-civic-tech.pdf">The Emergence of Civic Tech: Investments in a Growing Field</a>,” finds more than $430 million dollars was invested in civic-based technology companies and organizations from January 2011 to May 2013.

According to the report, investments from 177 private capital firms and foundations went to 102 civic tech companies and organizations during that time.

Organizations that received the largest amounts of funding include Airbnb ($118M), NextDoor ($40M), Waze ($30M), CouchSurfing ($22M), Zimride ($21M), Getaround ($19M), Open Data Institute ($16M), Change.org ($15M) and Sunlight Foundation ($15M).

Of note is that none of these companies have an open source component and none are focused on actually helping government become more efficient.

As a category, "peer-to-peer local sharing" companies comprise more than half of the funding ($233 million).

Knight also created an <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/features/civictech/">interactive feature</a> to help visualize the data.
