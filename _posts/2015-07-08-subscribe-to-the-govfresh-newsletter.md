A few weeks ago, we added an email subscription option, and the sign-up rate has been incredible.

So, starting next week, every Thursday, we'll send out a simple GovFresh newsletter that includes the following:
<ul>
	<li>Latest GovFresh posts</li>
	<li>Links to other itemsÂ we find interesting</li>
</ul>
I'd love feedback anyone has on what would be of interest and/or newsletter examples that are particularly compelling. Please send your ideas to me at <a href="mailto:luke@govfresh.com">luke@govfresh.com</a>.
