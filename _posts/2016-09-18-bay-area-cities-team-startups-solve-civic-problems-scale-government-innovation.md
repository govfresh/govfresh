Bay Areas cities San Francisco, Oakland, West Sacramento and San Leandro teamed with startups this year as part of the <a href="https://startupinresidence.org/">Startup in Residence</a> program to "explore ways to use technology to make government more accountable, efficient and responsive."

The <a href="https://startupinresidence.org/2016-stir-teams/">2016 cohort</a> included 14 companies that worked with the cities over 16 weeks, and the teams made their presentations Friday (see <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=stir2016&amp;src=typd">#STIR2016</a>).

All of the projects were fantastic, but <a href="https://binti.com/">Binti</a> really stood out and opened my eyes to the impact modernized technology can have on truly changing lives.

The STIR program started in 2014 and serves as a model for other geographic regions that want to create momentum around civic technology and scaling government innovation.

Big shout to Jeremy Goldberg, Krista Canellakis, Jay Nath, the <a href="http://innovatesf.com/">SF Office of Civic Innovation</a>, an incredible team of <a href="https://startupinresidence.org/mentors-advisors/">ambassadors and mentors</a>, Monique Woodard from 500 Startups and, of course, Lawrence Grodeska and the <a href="http://civicmakers.com/">CivicMakers</a> team. It's inspiring to see public sector leaders working proactively with startups to break through the procurement and technology mold and bring better digital services to those they serve.

For those interested in participating in the the 2017 cohort, see the <a href="https://startupinresidence.org/2016-application-for-statups/city-requirements-values/">participation requirements</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfreQRknSI97dRL9RcZbCD01vH7SiM40MQNS8hAw1rZOAMJBA/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">apply</a>.
