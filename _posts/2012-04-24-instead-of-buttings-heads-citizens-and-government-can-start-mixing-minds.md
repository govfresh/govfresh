<a href="http://mindmixer.com/">MindMixer</a> is working with the <a href="http://www.improvesf.com">San Francisco</a>, <a href="http://ideas.la2b.org/">Los Angeles</a> and other local communities to help crowdsource ideas for civic improvement. CEO and Co-Founder Nick Bowden discusses his venture and the value of government-citizen collaboration.

<h2>Give us the 140-character elevator pitch.</h2>

A simple web and mobile platform that generates a broader audience and creates effective and measurable citizen participation.

<h2>What problem does MindMixer solve for government?</h2>

Cities struggle to engage a cross section of the community on a variety of topics at a reasonable cost. MindMixer solves that problem by providing a robust engagement platform that allows citizens to participate on topics where they have an interest.

<h2>Whatâ€™s the story behind starting MindMixer?</h2>

MindMixer launched in March of 2011 as an answer to the long-standing problem of decreasing citizen involvement in local decision-making. Nick Bowden and Nathan Preheim founded the company as former urban planners frustrated with consistently low turnout at public meetings.

<h2>What are its key features?</h2>

MindMixer believes strongly that idea submission is only one aspect of the participation process. In addition to basic crowdsourcing functionality, MindMixer also offers prioritization tools, interactive budgeting tools, map-based inputs, and online surveys. Additionally, MindMixer employs a unique community-based reward system. Participants earn points for quality participation and can in turn "cash" those points in for civic rewards.

<h2>What are the costs, pricing plans?</h2>

MindMixer offers a range of affordable pricing options from $3,000 - $25,000 for a 12 month period. Pricing is largely dependent on the size of the municipality. 

<h2>How can those interested connect with you?</h2>
