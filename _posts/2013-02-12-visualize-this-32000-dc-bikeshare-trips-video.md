The Capital Bikeshare in Washington, D.C. has been on my dataviz short list since I first <a title="Boston Hubway Data Visualization" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PlHZJ3hhlI">took a crack at Boston’s Hubway data</a> last fall. At the urging of a fellow Urban Planning student and bona fide NYC bike nut, I set out to bring the D.C. system’s open data to life. (The Capital Bikeshare is run by Alta, who will also be implementing Citibike in NYC this year)

In the 32,000 trips included in the 5-day sample, rush hour surges, pulses of local traffic, cross-river commutes, and 3 a.m. Sunday morning “Rides of Shame” can be seen throughout the city.  Trip starts are represented by Blue dots, which quickly fade away.  If the trip ended at a different bikeshare station (as most do), a moving yellow dot appears, covering a straight-line path between the start and end station.  Weekday peaks occur at 9 am and 6 pm, and system appears to be well-used all day long on the weekends.

Capital Bikeshare opened <a title="Capital Bikeshare Trip Data" href="http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/trip-history-data">their data</a> in early 2012 and has been useful for visualizers and transit developers alike.
