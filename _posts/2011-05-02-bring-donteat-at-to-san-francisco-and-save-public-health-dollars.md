date: 2011-05-02
description: Today on Gov 2.0 Radio, Allison Hornery of CivicTEC in Sydney pointed to a new app by New York University computer science student Max Stoller that mashes up NY health inspection data with Foursquare, and provides a text message warning if the restaurant isn’t making the grade. It’s called DontEat.At.

In <a href="http://www.govloop.com/profiles/blogs/how-yelp-could-help-save" target="_blank">a powerfully argued post at GovLoop</a> back in January, Canadian open data advisor <a href="http://twitter.com/daeaves" target="_blank">David Eaves</a> offered a solution for saving millions in public health costs: create  data standards around restaurant healthfulness inspection scores and  incorporate them into consumer-oriented websites like <a href="http://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank">Yelp</a> and <a href="http://www.opentable.com/" target="_blank">OpenTable</a>.


Last night on <a href="http://gov20radio.com/ross-mayfield-camps-clouds-sharing-socialtext-slideshare-and-the-obama-long-form/" target="_blank">Gov 2.0 Radio</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/allisonhornery" target="_blank">Allison Hornery</a> of <a href="http://civictec.org/" target="_blank">CivicTEC</a> in Sydney pointed to a new  app by New York University computer science student <a href="http://twitter.com/maxstoller" target="_blank">Max Stoller</a> that mashes up NY health inspection data with <a href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a>, and provides a text message warning if the restaurant isn't making the grade. It's called <a href="http://donteat.at/" target="_blank">DontEat.At</a>.

I'd  really like to see Yelp, OpenTable and Facebook step up to the plate  and take on this important public health goal in San Francisco. We've  got the data, and <a href="http://sfscores.com/" target="_blank">SFScores.com</a> is already using it in a user-friendly map. Incorporating it into  restaurant sites and apps would make this data more accessible, and more  likely to reduce public health risks.

While we're waiting for Yelp and OpenTable, I'd love to see Max bring his app here.

Max, if you're reading, <a href="http://agent99.sfdph.org/" target="_blank">here's the raw data</a>.
