The 2014 <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/">Code for America Summit</a> kicks off today in San Francisco and runs through Thursday. For most of you reading this, 99% of your Twitter stream will reference what has become one of the most important government technology events of the year.

Whether you're attending in real life or want to live vicariously through those of us lucky to be there, here are seven things you need to know about the 2014 Code for America Summit.

<ol>
	<li>Registration may end by the time you read this, but if not, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-2014-code-for-america-summit-registration-11424407711">hurry</a>.</li>
	<li>The Twitter hashtag is <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cfasummit&amp;src=typd">#CfASummit</a>. This should already be obvious, but just in case, now you know.</li>
	<li>There is a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/">livestream</a> available for those not at the event. If you miss a talk you really wanted to hear, don't panic, CfA has done a great job in the past of posting these within days.</li>
	<li>Tuesday night there is a <a href="http://civiclounge.com">Civic Lounge</a> social. You must RSVP to be admitted. If you don't have the password, send me an email (luke@govfresh.com), and I'll make sure you get it.</li>
	<li>If you see a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/sponsors/">sponsor</a> rep, give them a big shout because they are the ones who financially contribute to help make it happen. Also, be sure to visit the <a href="https://cfasummit2014.pathable.com/organizations/list?per_page=24&amp;sort_mode=asc">Civic Tech Fair</a> to show them your love.</li>
	<li>Don't worry about pretense. This is the most approachable, accessible group of people you will ever nerd out with. If there's someone you want to meet, introduce yourself and say hi.</li>
	<li>If you see someone with a Code for America badge, buy them a drink, pay this month's rent, or offer to wash and iron their track jackets. None of this would have happened without  the incredible time, effort and passion they put into creating an amazing event.</li>
</ol>

I'm excited to see old friends and meet the new class of civic hackers and innovators looking to change the way government works and, hopefully, get the chance to meet you.
