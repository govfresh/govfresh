A few years ago after I let the first government WordPress theme I created languish, I got an email from <a href="http://cityofferndale.org">City of Ferndale</a> Assistant City Administrator <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=99595628&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=1vhd&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1427401769754%2Ctas%3Asam+taylor">Sam Taylor</a> asking if he could get the latest version (which was no longer available).

Sam's email was the impetus for building a new theme, now called <a href="https://govpress.govfresh.org">GovPress</a>, that <a href="http://wptheming.com/">Devin Price</a> and I developed with his feedback, and Ferndale deployed a beta version in July of 2013 (more on the history <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/govfresh/govpress-wordpress-simplifying-small-city-websites">here</a>).

Given the recent discussion around analytics and the new <a href="http://analytics.usa.gov">analytics.usa.gov</a>, I asked Sam if I could see Ferndale's, mostly because I was curious as to how or if a new design had changed user traffic and site activity.

I'll let the screenshot above speak for itself.

What's important to understand here is that, no matter how small a city you are, you can deploy a low-cost website, including a content management system and design with a simple, mobile-friendly interface and provide immediate results for citizens.
