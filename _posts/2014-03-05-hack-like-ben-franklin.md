Code for America's Catherine Bracy has a great TED Talk on civic hacking and one of America's greatest civic hackers, Ben Franklin, inspired a brigade of do-good developers across the world.

Her Mexico City anecdote is an especially inspiring example of civic hacking at its best, as Bracy says, creating "a twenty-first century ecosystem of participation. They're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to get involved besides voting or signing a petition or protesting. They can actually build government."
