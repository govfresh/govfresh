I'm still stunned and heartbroken by the news that we've <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/cyclist-participating-in-charity-ride-dies-in-collision-with-car/2015/09/19/ed04a6ec-5f2f-11e5-9757-e49273f05f65_story.html?postshare=9121442746537148">lost Jake Brewer</a>.

Jake and I met six years ago at TransparencyCamp West, where I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=033uf_--_yU">interviewed him</a> and was able to capture a little bit of how he saw the world, and what needed to be done to make it better.

The last time we communicated was via text on his first day in his new role with the White House and, in between those years, as he has with so many others, he always inspired me with his graceful approach to change and impact.

After I got the news Sunday morning, I started to watch the interview and broke down in disbelief and sadness that I still feel as I write this.

There have been countless, beautiful anecdotes on Jake's compassion, humility and contributions, and there's nothing I can add that would do justice to honor the influence he's had on me other than to say, Jake, I miss you so much, and you will be with me always as I try to live up to the standards you set for those of us still here.
