The guidance is part of the Biden Administration's "[Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/)" executive order.

From the announcement:

> The CX CoE has created this framework to help organizations transform their federal service delivery. It is designed to provide organizations with a deeper understanding of how to measure their maturity level, and tactics to get to the next level. Although the CX Maturity Model does not represent or constitute official guidance, it can help you take your organizationâ€™s CX Maturity to the next level.
