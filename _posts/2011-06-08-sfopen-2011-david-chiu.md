<hr />

<h3>Committed to the Open Government Pledge for San Francisco?</h3>

Yes. 

<h3>Open government statement</h3>

<blockquote>"For open government to mature, San Francisco needs a mayor who speaks the language of the tech community and believes deeply that technology can engage a sometimes disconnected public â€“ and make government work better in lean budget times. As the former founder of a small technology company, I am uniquely suited to be a mayor who makes San Francisco the undisputed leader on open government."</blockquote>
