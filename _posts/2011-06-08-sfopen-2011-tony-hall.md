<em>As part of <a href="http://sf.govfresh.com/sfopen2011/">SFOpen 2011</a>, we're featuring the <a href="http://sf.govfresh.com/candidates/">San Francisco mayoral candidates</a> and their thoughts and ideas on open government and Government 2.0. We're interviewing each of them and have asked them to commit to the <a href="http://sf.govfresh.com/sf-mayoral-candidates-an-open-government-pledge-for-san-francisco/">Open Government Pledge for San Francisco</a>. </em>

Meet Tony Hall.

<hr />

<h3>Committed to the Open Government Pledge for San Francisco?</h3>

No, but offered this statement:

<blockquote>“While I don’t sign others’ pledges (only my own), I absolutely agree with the spirit of the language and just wish it were tougher on corruption. I hope you will note my reasons for my decision.”</blockquote>

<h3>Open government statement</h3>

<blockquote>"We must take on the powerful special interests that have undue influence at City Hall. The best way is to have an open and transparent government that is unafraid of scrutiny, because it is always striving to serve its people. All city departments must have sunshine policies and public input."</blockquote>
