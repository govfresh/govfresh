The White House is now accepting applications for the 2014 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows program</a>. Deadline is April 7.

From the PIF application:

<blockquote>The Presidential Innovation Fellows program brings the principles, values, and practices of the innovation economy into government through the most effective agents of change we know: our people. This highly competitive program pairs talented, diverse individuals from the innovation community with top civil servants to tackle many of our Nationâ€™s biggest challenges, and to achieve a profound and lasting social impact. These teams of government experts and private-sector doers are using approaches like design thinking and lean startup to achieve results for the American people in months, not years.
</blockquote>

Fellowships start late June/early July. <a href="https://gsafas.secure.force.com/apply">Apply here.</a>
