The state of California annouced the formation of a new Office of Data & Innovation, which includes a merger of the Office of Digital Innovation (now CalInnovate), the CalData team and the Center for Government Excellence and Transformation.

From the announcement:

> Bringing all these teams into one office will strengthen everyone. CalData knows how to empower data-driven decisions. CalInnovate helps state departments improve the design and delivery of services they provide. The GET Center pilots ways to improve state operations. Each fuels the other and by combining forces we can do even more great work for Californians.
