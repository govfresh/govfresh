<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Governments want to acquire AI solutions to streamline processes  and provide insights into key sectors such as transportation, healthcare  and public services. However, officials often lack experience in  acquiring such solutions and many public institutions are cautious about  harnessing this rapidly developing technology at a time when we are  only beginning to understand the risks as well as the opportunities. </p><p>Growing public concerns around bias, privacy, accountability and  transparency of the technology has added an extra layer of complexity to  a potential roll out on a national level. The <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Guidelines_for_AI_Procurement.pdf" target="_blank">AI Procurement Guidelines for Governments</a> </strong>have been designed help officials keep up with this rapidly developing technology and mitigate the risks.</p><p>The guidelines were co-designed by the World Economic Forum’s  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning team and fellows embedded  from UK Government’s Office of AI, Deloitte, Salesforce and Splunk.  Members of government, academia, civil society and the private sector  were consulted throughout a ten-month development process, which  incorporated workshops and interviews with government procurement  officials and private sector procurement professionals. </p><p>The report provides the requirements a government official should  address before acquiring and deploying AI solutions and services. It  also provides the questions that companies should answer about their AI  development and how the data is used and processed. The guidelines also  include explanatory text elaborating on how to implement, key questions  to ask and case studies. </p></blockquote>
