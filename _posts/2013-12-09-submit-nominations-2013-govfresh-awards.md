I'm excited to announce the <a href="http://awards.govfresh.com">2013 GovFresh Awards</a> celebrating and honoring the greatest civic innovators and innovations of 2013.

From now until December 14, anyone can submit an entry and vote on submissions. A panel of judges from around the world will then select winners from the top three vote-getters in each category. Winners will be announced December 18.

As with all awards programs, there will be a select few winners, but what I'm most interested in is learning about all the great work that was accomplished in 2013. Because the nominations process is open and visible to the public, my hope is that the civic innovation community, journalists and citizens will get a big picture take on 2013.
