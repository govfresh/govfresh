I finished reading Charles Duhigg's latest book, "<a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/books/smarter-faster-better/">Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business</a>," and in it are two great government-related anecdotes around motivation and agile thinking.

The first shares how the U.S. Marines re-imagined the boot camp experience to inspire self-motivation and leadership in new recruits. The second is the Federal Bureau of Investigation's well-documented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_(FBI)">Sentinel</a> project, and it's subsequent approach to agile development to get the project back on track.

The entire book is worth reading, and these two examples highlight the potential for government to think outside the box and change entrenched ways of thinking, get on a new path to impacting millions of others.

Duhigg is also the author of "<a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/books/the-power-of-habit/">The Power of Habit</a>."
