<p>"This year we evaluated 20 Executive Branch agencies, including all 15 cabinet-level departments," says the Center for Plain Language. "Agencies earned grades between A and F for both organizational compliance, covering the staffing, training, and annual reporting required by law, and writing, focusing on how easy it is to find, understand, and use information the public needs. For this year’s writing grade, we looked at two online pages from each agency."</p>
