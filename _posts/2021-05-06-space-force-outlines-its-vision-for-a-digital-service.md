<!-- quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Vision for a Digital Service is founded on three key tenets that provide a pathway to a faster, more innovative, and agile service designed to meet the unique demands of the space operating environment: an Interconnected, Innovative, Digitally Dominant force.<br><br>First, an <strong>Interconnected</strong> force effectively and efficiently shares relevant information with a broad array of stakeholders in support of the mission.&nbsp;<br><br>Second, an <strong>Innovative</strong> force routinely embraces new approaches and readily challenges the status quo.&nbsp;<br><br>Third, a <strong>Digitally Dominant</strong> force depends on people – establishing an empowered, digitally fluent workforce that advocates for innovation from every angle.&nbsp;<br><br>Informed by these tenets, the Vision for a Digital Service outlines four focus areas that serve as lines of effort for the necessary digital transformation Guardians must lead to achieve this vision:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Digital Engineering:</strong> The Space Force will foster an interoperable, resilient, and secure Digital Engineering Ecosystem (DEE) that will enable Guardians across the force to rapidly mature innovative concepts into integrated solutions and deliver critical warfighting capability faster.</p></blockquote>

<!-- quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Digital Workforce:</strong> The Space Force will attract, educate, develop, and retain the vital talent they need to cultivate digital fluency among all Guardians, and the USSF will equip and empower them to unleash their talent and energy toward bold, innovative solutions.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /quote -->

<!-- quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Digital Headquarters:</strong> This focus area refers to a function, rather than a location – it represents the ability for all Guardians to make decisions efficiently by removing layers of bureaucracy and enabling and incentivizing data-driven decision making.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /quote -->

<!-- quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Digital Operations:</strong> The Space Force will drive joint, all-domain solutions in, from, and to space, exploiting advantages provided by interconnected infrastructure and an innovative, digitally-fluent workforce.</p></blockquote>
