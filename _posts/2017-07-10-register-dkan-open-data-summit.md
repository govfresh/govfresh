Government has very few true open source open data options, and <a href="http://getdkan.com/">DKAN</a> is one of them.

For those passionate about cultivating a more sustainable, open source oriented open data community, the first <a href="http://www.dkansummit.org/">DKAN Open Data Summit</a> is scheduled for August 1, 2017, in Washington, D.C.

<a href="http://www.dkansummit.org/">DKAN Open Data Summit</a> will be held in tandem with <a href="https://www.drupalgovcon.org/">Drupal GovCon</a>, and you must register for the latter to attend the former.

DKAN currently powers several federal, state and local government open data platforms, including the <a href="https://www.healthdata.gov/">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>, the <a href="https://data.ca.gov/">state of California</a>, <a href="https://data.louisvilleky.gov/">Louisville</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NuCivic/dkan-sites">many others</a>.
