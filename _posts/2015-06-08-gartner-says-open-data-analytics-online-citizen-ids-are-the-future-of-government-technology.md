Gartner released a top 10 list of trends that will drive government technology for the foreseeable future, including open data, citizen online identification, analytics and flexible cloud options.

The research company says technology spending by governments globally will fall 1.8 percent from $439 billion to $431 billion in 2015, then grow to $475.5 billion by 2019.

Gartner's top 10 government IT trends:

<ul>
	<li>Digital Workplace</li>
	<li>Multichannel Citizen Engagement</li>
	<li>Open Any Data</li>
	<li>Citizen e-ID</li>
	<li>Edge Analytics</li>
	<li>Scalable Interoperability</li>
	<li>Digital Government Platforms</li>
	<li>Internet of Things</li>
	<li>Web-Scale IT</li>
	<li>Hybrid Cloud (and IT)</li>
</ul>

Key excerpts:

<blockquote>"Organizations adopting a Web-scale IT philosophy will largely eschew the acquisition of expensive, scalable computing, storage and networking resources in favor of lower-cost, open-source-derived hardware that bypasses the traditional infrastructure "middlemen." Consequently, traditional IT suppliers and delivery modes will become less relevant to government IT."

... 

"Government CIOs will need to reposition IT organizations from being full-service providers of IT services to being their agencies' preferred brokers and managers of services offered predominantly through the cloud."
</blockquote>
