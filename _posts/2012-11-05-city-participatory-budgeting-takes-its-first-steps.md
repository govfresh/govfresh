This past September, Vallejo, Ca., began the <a href="http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/us/vallejo/vallejo-launches-first-city-wide-pb-in-us/">United States' first citywide venture</a> in <a href="http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/">participatory budgeting</a>, allowing residents to directly decide how $3.4 million dollars of public money would be spent. Four years ago, the city declared bankruptcy.
