# CDO Playbook 

Advancing the Federal Data Strategy 

# Introduction 

The federal Chief Data Officer (CDO) position is a pivotal and transformational role that can significantly benefit the collection, organization, analysis and use of data in the agency as well as improve its value to society. The CDO must embrace the roles of change agent and evangelist to bring the inspirational vision of what data can do for all stakeholders.

CDOs must seize opportunities to leverage data as a strategic asset within their organization, otherwise, the CDO faces the risk of becoming a compliance driven position. The CDO should first focus on finding opportunities to promote the sharing and access of data within their agencies. They must build critical relationships and show value in the near-term through “quick wins,” as data governance and master data management programs take longer to implement and demonstrate results. It is a hard job with a value proposition not consistently appreciated and with challenges that are critical to overcome to properly serve their stakeholders and the American people. 

Federal agencies are at different points of their data journey. While some CDOs have data science teams that are leveraging advanced analytics to derive meaningful insights, others have little to no budget or staffing resources to carry out the initiatives that support their data vision and strategy. A 2020 Gartner survey shows 14% of CDOs have been in their roles for less than a year.1 Many come into their role finding data silos throughout their agency, with  data in disparate places and data functions mostly decentralized. CDO reporting and organizational structures also vary from agency to agency. Despite all this, CDOs must demonstrate early value generation, providing capabilities that build credibility and distinguish themselves as an executive far from the back office with a seat at the leadership table. 

Gartner. CDO Agenda 2021: Influence and Impact of Successful CDOs in the Sixth Annual CDO Survey. March 2021. 

Federal CDOs come into their role needing a wide array of skills. They must be data evangelists responsible for changing the agency culture to use data to solve real problems and to adopt enterprise data standards that improve overall data quality as a by-product. They must inspire agency offices to engage in a shared unified vision for data by demonstrating they are strategic thinkers who understand how data can drive better agency outcomes and be of greater value to society. Much like the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPMs) five executive core qualifications (ECQs), it takes a variety of leadership skills, both hard and soft,2 to build trusting relationships with key stakeholders and advance the mission of their agency. 

According to federal CDOs, persons in this position must have the ability to: 

* Communicate and translate complex concepts to all audiences 

* Understand and prioritize organizational business challenges and deliver value in these areas 

* Build and lead teams across the organization 

* Remain goal oriented and focused on reaching specified objectives by establishing structure and managing towards outcomes 

* Adapt and deal with different issues of importance to different customers 

* Influence others to realize the mission value of data 

* Manage change within organizations The goal of this playbook is to help you be key value drivers as the federal government expands its use of data as a strategic asset.

# About this playbook  

The CDO Playbook is an iterative document that explores and defines the evolution of the federal CDO role. It provides new and existing CDOs with guiding principles, opportunities for quick wins, and best practices to navigate some of the key areas that CDOs should focus on today and over the next few years. The CDO Council’s Data Skills Working Group (WG) created this playbook of four key “plays” which draws from successful practices in both industry and government. It is advice from CDOs to other CDOs, hence you will notice the informal tone and admonitions of what ‘you’ should consider. It leverages and cites concrete examples from federal CDOs on how they have applied specific strategies and approaches to make progress in each Play to deliver value in this evolving role as a change management leader.  

## The plays  

### Play #1 

Cultivate strong relationships to partner on solving mission problems with data.  

### Play #2 

Promote data sharing and break organizational silos.  

### Play #3 

Build a data-driven culture by taking the lead to improve data literacy and acumen within your agency.  

### Play #4 

Drive transformation through a mission focused data and analytics strategy that can influence the enterprise-wide business strategy and answer key agency questions. 
To prepare this playbook, a small working group of CDOs from both large and small agencies participated in discovery meetings to understand how they define their role based on each of their experiences. Their successes, agency culture, pain points, and understanding of data management were assessed to recommend and agree on the four key plays. There is no one-size-fits all approach to the strategies a CDO will execute against these plays and no specific starting point. They are highly interrelated an`d are not prescribed in any order, instead quick wins to demonstrate value are possible from any point throughout all the plays. The information provided unearthed commonalities among people, process, technology, and data distinctions prevalent in many agencies. This playbook is meant to be illustrative and insightful for recognizing value-based opportunities for any agency.

# Play #1

Cultivate strong relationships to partner on solving mission problems with data.  

Establish partnerships to realize quick wins - CDOs are most successful when they engage and influence key stakeholders. Your stakeholder engagement strategy should focus on forging relationships before zeroing in on data governance activities that may risk appearing solely compliance driven.

## Key strategic actions  

1.1 Identify your key stakeholders and learn how best to engage them in problem solving through collaborative working relationships.  

1.2 Engage IT decision makers to build partnerships around data priorities.  

1.3 Partner with stakeholders from across agency offices to collaborate on pilot projects that solve specific business problems.  

1.4 CDOs should work with executive stakeholders to demonstrate how data and analytics initiatives address agency challenges. 

1.5 Continuously engage with decisionmaking executives and other key stakeholders to continue value proposition discussions and the value of data. Agencywide representation and support gives a broader lens to the organizational drivers and constraints needed to make datarelated decisions.  

1.6 Communicate to your entire workforce the progress, successes from your quick wins, and plans for building and delivering long-term capabilities for the agency. 

### 1.1 Identify your key stakeholders and learn how best to engage them in problem solving through collaborative working relationships.  

#### Key activities

* Conduct a stakeholder analysis starting with leadership, then moving to agency or sub-agency offices. Key stakeholders should include a variety of levels of data expertise including agency data stewards with expertise in working with data as well as offices unaware of their data capabilities.

* Interview stakeholders to identify their mission needs and challenges. Give them opportunities to voice their interests and priorities. Some example interview topics include priority questions, as well as data needs, acumen, access gaps, and opportunities, etc. 

* Use stakeholder needs to guide decisions about how to remove any relevant organizational obstacles related to data goals and identify potential project opportunities.  

#### Common pitfalls

* Do not just start with data governance for the sake of data governance, partner on key questions to drive value. CDOs can improve data governance and data quality as needed to meet agency goals. 

### 1.2 Engage IT decision makers to build partnerships around data priorities. 

#### Key activities

* Actively engage with key IT partners to collaborate on planned IT projects where data transformation opportunities exist or to gain access to IT environments and tools needed for future data projects. 

* Develop understanding of the relationship between CDOs and Chief Information Officer (CIO) even where there is no direct reporting relationship. 

* Cultivate consensus with the CIO and other leaders on shared priorities. This common understanding is significant because of the interdependent nature of the two roles. 

* Build coalitions with key IT partners to seamlessly integrate into the IT investment and governance processes within your agency. IT and data priorities are connected and often share interdependent goals of generating increased business value. 

* Ensure you are aware of the types of planned and current IT investments and projects to prioritize key data activities. This strategic relationship building tactic demonstrates your ability to develop meaningful partnerships.  

### 1.3 Partner with stakeholders from across agency offices to collaborate on pilot projects that solve specific business problems.

Successful small-scale projects or “quick wins” build the credibility needed to support longer-term goals.  

#### Key activities

* Deliver solutions quickly and communicate wins to demonstrate value to your agency to increase support and buy-in for your data vision. 

* Plan pilot projects such as data prototyping opportunities with interested agency offices to achieve fast results to make the case for data investment to executives. 

* Focus on the “What’s In It For Me” (WIIFM) by having value conversations and asking if stakeholders see additional business opportunities so you can further ideate on solutions leveraging analytics capabilities.  

#### Agency example  

* The CDO at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) developed Human Resources (HR) dashboards with consistent information data collected from 19 different component agencies. This quick win initiative demonstrated labor savings by moving away from siloed approaches, which ultimately led to confidence for more data projects and deployments in other mission areas.  

### 1.4 CDOs should work with executive stakeholders to demonstrate how data and analytics initiatives address agency challenges.  

#### Key activities

* Conduct targeted discussions with key executive stakeholders to obtain their buy-in for your proposed data priorities and high-impact solutions. 

* Identify and prioritize solutions to your agency’s data challenges which connect to agency mission goals and manage time and risk. 

* Implement foundational initiatives, for example, developing data definitions and standards or more focused use cases to build more capabilities over time. 

* Review lessons learned from previous pilot projects to factor into your plans.  

### 1.5 Continuously engage with decisionmaking executives and other key stakeholders to continue value proposition discussions and the value of data. Agencywide representation and support gives a broader lens to the organizational drivers and constraints needed to make datarelated decisions. 

#### Key activities

* Ensure executive sponsorship and support for your data priorities to build momentum and encourage investment to address data issues throughout your organization. 

* Conduct strategic discussions with a stated purpose and desired outcome, whether it is to inform, gain support, or ask for funding. 

### 1.6 Communicate to your entire workforce the progress, successes from your quick wins, and plans for building and delivering long-term capabilities for the agency. 

#### Key activities

* Build organizational awareness through agency-wide communication that keeps employees interested in your agency’s data transformation journey. 

* Effectively communicate about data transformations, how to get involved, and share tools are available to build awareness and trust. 

* Anticipate questions from stakeholders on the value of working with the CDO. 

## Play 1 lesson learned 

* Identify data champions throughout the agency who demonstrate how they are leveraging data for better decisionmaking and improving overall data quality for their programs. 

* Prioritize the data analytics community as a key stakeholder, learn and understand their needs and identify ways to meet them.

# Play #2 

Promote data sharing and break organizational silos.  

Effective data management enables data sharing and access across the enterprise which can eliminate data redundancies and lead to overall improved data quality and provide better services. Additionally, data analytics and emerging technologies are dependent on having strong and acceptable data management functions in place, so you have quality data with which to work. The CDO role is to break down organizational silos to foster better transparency and collaboration into the data needed to succeed in transformation projects.  

## Key strategic actions 

2.1 Collaborate with your CIO Office, statistical official, and evaluation officer (if present in your agency) to understand the history of your agency’s data and infrastructure maturity. 

2.2 Identify a strategy to optimally organize and assign data stewards across the enterprise.  

2.3 Provide opportunities to train and empower data stewards to be effective in their role.  

2.4 Establish an automated means to manage stewardship responsibilities.  

2.5 Collaborate with data stewards to develop data lifecycle management best practices. The OPEN Government Data Act mandates that CDOs establish data management best practices to improve the quality of agency data. 

2.6 Determine how your data management program will be organized. The data management domains of your program will serve as inputs to your data management strategy (see next step). 

2.7 Develop a data management strategy in collaboration with your CIO, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Enterprise Architect or Chief Data Architect, and agency leadership, based on the findings and inputs from earlier action steps. A data management strategy will help you think through how to prioritize investments and resource allocations (e.g., data analytics, data infrastructure). 

2.8 Develop an Organizational Change Management (OCM) plan to support your data management strategy. Integrating change management strategies can successfully persuade stakeholders to implement or adjust data management methods or practices.  

2.9 Prioritize data sharing projects that generate measurable business outcomes and align with strategic objectives. Using an incremental approach to data management not only delivers benefits to impacted business stakeholders but it also helps you gain quick wins.  

2.10 Collaborate with data stewards to develop common business language, such as data term definitions for metadata. Managing metadata vocabularies, formats, and standards ensures a common understanding across the agency of data meaning and its uses. 

2.11 Identify data consolidation opportunities across database systems including data sharing and access between business lines. Evaluating data management and analytics capabilities can help you identify open source or shared service opportunities across systems to improve cost efficiency. 

2.12 Design a conceptual target data architecture and enterprise solution for databases and other data platforms creating an environment to establish formal data standards. Establishing a target data architecture brings your strategy and the technology side together to show the relationships between your agency’s data functions, technologies, and types.  

2.13 Begin data aggregation activities for data consolidation, integration, and service projects. This action ensures you have compiled and processed all the data from different databases needed for your data projects. 

2.14 Define and track performance metrics across your data management program functions and monitor overall progress toward them. The information collected provides feedback and inputs into your data management strategy.  

2.15 Routinely assess all agency data management tools and technologies (e.g., data analytics capabilities) including Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs for efficiencies. With the evolution of data tools, it is important to constantly evaluate your existing resources to determine where cost savings opportunities are. 

### 2.1 Collaborate with your CIO Office, statistical official, and evaluation officer (if present in your agency) to understand the history of your agency’s data and infrastructure maturity.  

#### Key activities

* Build in-depth knowledge of the agency’s data history and infrastructure maturity. 

* Gain familiarity with the business cases for the agency’s planned investments to understand context and set expectations before engaging with individual agency offices. 

* Conduct knowledge transfer meetings to help uncover operational silos and determine data sharing needs of stakeholders who perform data management functions. Gather available documentation on existing data systems and their IT environments (e.g., the IT infrastructure).  

### 2.2 Identify a strategy to optimally organize and assign data stewards across the enterprise. 

#### Key activities

* Implement a data stewardship model to break silos across agency offices and create partnerships between the CDO and agency offices as well as amongst data stewards themselves. 

* Organize stewards across your organization to establish accountability and responsibility for the processes that ensure effective control and use of data. As defined in # Play #1, first identify all the data stewards across various business lines performing data management and analytics functions. 

* Engage with these stakeholders to build consensus on a standard set of core principles and clear expectations of stewards.  

### 2.3 Provide opportunities to train and empower data stewards to be effective in their role.  

#### Key activities

* Facilitate cross-sharing of best practices for data usage by having meetings with informal data stewards to discuss the activities they perform in managing their data. 

* Work iteratively with informal data stewards to develop a stewardship framework based on their input and feedback, and gain consensus on their role (e.g., tracking data inventories and collections. 

* Coordinate with data stewards to identify the linkages needed between datasets, and to lead cross organizational projects. This type of framework empowers data stewards by considering their needs and opinions and fosters knowledge sharing.  

### 2.4 Establish an automated means to manage stewardship responsibilities.  

#### Key activities

* Gain additional insights across silos of operations and support any future data standardization projects. 

* Document all existing data assets to show the value of agency data. 

* Engage with data stewards to obtain and document business requirements and use cases for their data systems. 

* Obtain relevant metadata and classify the types of data being collected, used, and stored which will require an automated means for stewards to interface and accumulate such data. Be sure to provide guidance for sharing and/or obfuscating/tokenizing sensitive data. Developing a metadata inventory is important for building trust and enabling data sharing.  

### 2.5 Collaborate with data stewards to develop data lifecycle management best practices. The OPEN Government Data Act mandates that CDOs establish data management best practices to improve the quality of agency data.  

#### Key activities

* Implement a data management program to develop decision making policies and procedures. 

* Raise agency data awareness early by developing best practices for managing agency data in partnership with data stewards. 

* Develop initial data standards on the representation of data to educate agency stakeholders about the value of data management, standards, architecture, and data driven decision making.  

#### Agency example  

* The CDO at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) created a steering committee and separate working groups both staffed by various FDA Center employees to identify data initiatives and come to consensus on recommendations for their organization. Using this approach created a process that creates a sense of ownership for data stewards, involving them in the decision-making which has led to stronger partnerships with the CDO.  

### 2.6 Determine how your data management program will be organized. The data management domains of your program will serve as inputs to your data management strategy (see next step).  

#### Key activities

* Create a data management framework connecting your agency’s data management program to the needs of your stakeholders. 

* Include senior leadership and the agency data analytics community as stakeholders so that data management can best inform analytics. 

* Implement data management frameworks which include specific disciplines, policies, and competencies that are applied throughout the data lifecycle. 

* Build agency capacity to establish formal data management policies and standards on implemented data assets. 

2.7 Develop a data management strategy in collaboration with your CIO, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Enterprise Architect or Chief Data Architect, and agency leadership, based on the findings and inputs from earlier action steps. A data management strategy will help you think through how to prioritize investments and resource allocations (e.g., data analytics, data infrastructure).  

#### Key activities

* Consider including collaborative activities and incremental data projects. 

* Align your agency’s IT strategy and modernization initiatives to the data management strategy to ensure IT and data are coordinated. 

* Explain how data analytics fits into your strategy.  

### 2.8 Develop an Organizational Change Management (OCM) plan to support your data management strategy. Integrating change management strategies can successfully persuade stakeholders to implement or adjust data management methods or practices. 

* Most importantly, engage senior and executive leadership from across business lines to garner support for your enterprise data management vision which ensures you have the backing from across the organization.

* Develop an OCM coupled with project management and system engineering approaches to drive successful, largescale transformations (e.g., IT or data modernization, workforce strategy, and policy changes). 

* Integrate OCM strategies into data projects to advance strategic relations, increase teamwork and stakeholder buy-in, reduce the risk of customer resistance, and enable operations to be more efficient in achieving the full value of an initiative. 

* Assess your agency’s culture to better understand which key stakeholders need to be involved in your data management initiatives and what methods will be effective in implementing them.

* Include consistent and ongoing communications tactics for any desired data initiatives to help stakeholders understand why they should adapt to new changes.  

### 2.9 Prioritize data sharing projects that generate measurable business outcomes and align with strategic objectives. Using an incremental approach to data management not only delivers benefits to impacted business stakeholders but it also helps you gain quick wins.  

#### Key activities

* Prioritize high-value impact projects, such as those at the management or secretary level, and leverage opportunities for data standardization and integration during planned IT projects. 

* Execute against your OCM plan, including communicating any upcoming and major milestones of your planned data projects to key stakeholders. 

#### Agency example 

* The CDO at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) built a master data management system for a very complex project collecting information required to determine the fee base for their regulatory service licensees. To become more transparent to their customers, they wanted to bring data from all lines of businesses throughout the agency to be granular enough to identify charges. The CDO identified data stewards from each of the offices that manage their own systems to collaborate on this project and share their data into this master data management system. 

### 2.10 Collaborate with data stewards to develop common business language, such as data term definitions for metadata. Managing metadata vocabularies, formats, and standards ensures a common understanding across the agency of data meaning and its uses.  

#### Key activities

* Establish strong metadata tags on data assets helps you find and manage data effectively. 

* Leverage relationships with data stewards to participate in these foundational data standardization efforts. This activity also supports data cleansing efforts for any forthcoming data projects.  

### 2.11 Identify data consolidation opportunities across database systems including data sharing and access between business lines. Evaluating data management and analytics capabilities can help you identify open source or shared service opportunities across systems to improve cost efficiency.  

#### Key activities

* Collaborate with data stewards to identify organizational silos throughout your agency, which can uncover redundancies and overlapping data in systems, tools, and processes. 

* Assess data tool usage and costs across the agency. Individual agency offices may be applying data analytics into their respective programs; therefore, it is imperative to assess current agency data tools including their licensing costs.  

### 2.12 Design a conceptual target data architecture and enterprise solution for databases and other data platforms creating an environment to establish formal data standards. Establishing a target data architecture brings your strategy and the technology side together to show the relationships between your agency’s data functions, technologies, and types. 

#### Key activities

* Use your target data architecture to provide the infrastructure to share or migrate data from where it is stored to where it can be analyzed. This data structure should include an infrastructure for a high-functioning analytical environment. 

* Create a solution that solves the needs of different stakeholders and leverages data as an organizational asset, to discourage agency data silos. An enterprise solution may also lower IT costs.  

### 2.13 Begin data aggregation activities for data consolidation, integration, and service projects. This action ensures you have compiled and processed all the data from different databases needed for your data projects.  

#### Key activities

* Implement enterprise data solutions will require gathering data from disparate sources within your agency and making sure you have high quality information data. 

* Consider data aggregation as a tool in all initiatives and projects. This means you need good extract, transform and load (ETL) capabilities, a necessary process for you to optimize your data for analytics.  

### 2.14 Define and track performance metrics across your data management program functions and monitor overall progress toward them. The information collected provides feedback and inputs into your data management strategy.  

#### Key activities

* Link your data management performance metrics to specific business performance metrics. 

* Design your data management program to drive or meet business outcomes. This means tracing business outcomes back to supporting analytics output and underlying data. 

### 2.15 Routinely assess all agency data management tools and technologies (e.g., data analytics capabilities) including Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs for efficiencies. With the evolution of data tools, it is important to constantly evaluate your existing resources to determine where cost savings opportunities are.  

#### Key activities

* Implement and maintain data management investments, a key role of the CDO. 

* Use your budgeting and data resource management process to show how you are prioritizing resources to meet agency needs.
