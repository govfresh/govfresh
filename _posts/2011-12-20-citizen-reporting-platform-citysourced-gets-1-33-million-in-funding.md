Location-based mobile reporting platform <a href="http://citysourced.com">CitySourced</a> announced it has raised $1.33 million in Series A financing. 

According to the company, the funding will be used for product development, sales and marketing efforts. 

CitySourced Founder and CEO Jason A. Kiesel said the company is profitable, but "when the opportunity to work with our current investor presented itself, the strategic potential it brought to the table was too valuable to pass up. We are very excited about accelerating our growth, improving on our existing product suite and the future at CitySourced."

CitySourced cites U.S. cities San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles, San Diego and Corpus Christi, as well as cities in Canada, United Kingdom, Nederland, Australia, and Abu Dhabi, as customers.
