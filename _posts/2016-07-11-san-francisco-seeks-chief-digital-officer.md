San Francisco announced the creation of a new <a href="http://digitalservices.sfgov.org/">internal digital agency</a> and is looking for a <a href="http://digitalservices.sfgov.org/CDSO.html">chief digital services officer</a> to lead its efforts.

From the announcement:

<blockquote>The Digital Services Team will partner with departments to modernize digital services citywide. Four fundamental principles guide this task: put the needs of residents first, focus on delivery and outcomes over process, promote an agile and data driven culture, and make City services accessible to everyone.
</blockquote>

It's unclear what the roadmap is for building a support team to execute the <a href="http://digitalservices.sfgov.org/assets/SF_DigitalServiceStrategy.pdf">city's digital strategy</a>, and what influence the new role will have in determining its underlying technology, but this is currently the best job opening in the San Francisco Bay Area.
