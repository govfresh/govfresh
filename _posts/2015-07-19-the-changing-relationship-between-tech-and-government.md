Silicon Valley venture capital firm a16z hosts an excellent <a href="http://a16z.com/2015/07/10/a16z-podcast-the-changing-relationship-between-tech-and-government/">discussion</a> with current Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and former mayor Adrian Fenty on its a16z Podcast series.

The episode, "<a href="http://a16z.com/2015/07/10/a16z-podcast-the-changing-relationship-between-tech-and-government/">The Changing Relationship Between Tech and Government</a>," touches on how the sharing economy has pushed government to let go of top-down innovation and find ways to collaborate with these new ventures, as well as get proactive inÂ cultivating an environment that supports local startup ecosystems.

Bowser shares her thoughts on how mayors can work with these new firms to better gauge the pulse of the residents and advises tech entrepreneurs to focus on the largely untapped market market of human services, such as affordable housing, health and wellbeing and homelessness.

The discussion also underscores the importance tech firms must give to the third of Steve Case's "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/steve-case-mind-the-3-ps/2014/05/30/b435c5e6-e5bc-11e3-afc6-a1dd9407abcf_story.html">3 P's</a>": policy.
