For those unsatisfied with the recent <a href="http://govfresh.com/2015/04/how-to-not-be-the-next-usaspending-gov/">USAspending.gov re-launch</a> and would like to submit public feedback, <a href="https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/USASpending-Issue-Tracker">there's now an official GitHub repo for that</a>.

While code source of the current USAspending.gov website isn't available at the repo, it's a great first step in that the federal government has created a formal channel for aggregating input from external stakeholders.
