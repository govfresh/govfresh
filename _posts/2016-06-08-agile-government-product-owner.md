<a href="http://www.agilegovleaders.org/">Agile Government Leadership</a> has launched a new online course focused on the <a href="http://www.agilegovleaders.org/academy/product-owner/">government product owner</a> and will host a webinar on June 16 to give an overview and answer questions.

The course, <a href="http://www.agilegovleaders.org/academy/product-owner/">Agile for the Government Product Owner</a>, part of the <a href="http://www.agilegovleaders.org/academy/">AGL Academy</a>, is free and self-guided. 

As <a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2015/11/20455/">I've mentioned here before</a>, the product owner is one of the most important, if not the most important, positions in government technology.
