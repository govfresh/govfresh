<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The Center for Strategic Foresight helps to keep us agile by encouraging creative and critical thinking on the latest trends facing government and society. Our goal is to stay focused on Congress’ top policy priorities and to help prepare policymakers for future challenges.”</p><p>GAO created the Center to enhance its ability to identify, monitor,  and analyze emerging issues. Located in GAO’s Office of Strategic  Planning and External Liaison, the Center is a unique entity in the  federal government, one that reflects the non-partisan independent  watchdog agency’s broad mandate to provide Congress with reliable,  fact-based information for overseeing federal agencies and programs. </p></blockquote>
