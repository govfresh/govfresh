The White House continues to roll out a better mobile experience with a newly-designed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog">White House blog</a>.

Of note, the layout is responsive and the daily schedule is now integrated into the daily "What's Happening" feed. Would be interesting to start seeing a feed of all things White House (YouTube, Twitter, etc.) somewhere.

I particularly like the fist-bump photo on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/site-feedback">feedback page</a>, much like what I incorporated into the footer of <a href="http://govfresh.github.io/whitehouse/">my White House homepage comp</a>.
