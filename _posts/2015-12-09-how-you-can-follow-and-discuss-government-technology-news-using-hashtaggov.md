I've been using <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> for a while now to follow government and civic technology news and, while it's mostly a tool for team communications, the integrations features make it a great way to manage and digest a lot of information.

Over the past year, I've set up these integrations to pipe in RSS or Twitter feeds by topic, organizations, government agencies and government IT media. Once a day, I log into a Slack team I created, which I've called <a href="http://hashtaggov.com/">HashtagGov</a>, and scroll through the daily news. In 15 minutes, I've surveyed everything I need and can get back to focusing on real work.

You can now <a href="https://hashtaggov.herokuapp.com/">join HashtagGov</a> and subscribe to channels that suit your interests. If you feel compelled to discuss something, feel free to chat your thoughts or share other news that might be of interest.

How it works:

<ol>
	<li><a href="https://hashtaggov.herokuapp.com/">Join the HashtagGov community</a></li>
	<li>Choose your #gov channels</li>
	<li>Follow the news and join the discussions</li>
</ol>
