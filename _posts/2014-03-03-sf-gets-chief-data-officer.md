In a Twitter exchange between San Francisco Chief Information Officer Marc Touitou and myself, Touitou confirmed that the city has appointed Joy Bonaguro as its first chief data officer.

According to Bonaguro's <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joybonaguro">LinkedIn profile</a>, she previously worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, U.S. Government Accountability Office and the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center in a variety of design, data and policy roles. See U.S. Department of Energy's profile of her <a href="http://energy.gov/diversity/articles/women-energy-joy-bonaguro">here</a>.

Her visual, information design and mapping background makes for an interesting, well-rounded choice in a role that has typically leaned heavily technical in other cities.

In March 2013, SF <a href="http://govfresh.com/2013/03/san-francisco-makes-open-data-city-policy/">proposed legislation</a> that included the creation of the CDO position and <a href="http://govfresh.com/2013/09/sf-officially-posts-chief-data-officer-position/">formally announced</a> the position opening in September.
