If there's one lesson that's inherent to CityCampSF, it's that crowdsourcing will save the world.

The second CityCamp San Francisco was hosted at the city's Office of Technology, and featured projects that heavily favored using the community residents to make their block, neighborhood or city better. My takeaway? While the state of California may have proven that direct democracy doesn't work, the city of San Francisco has shown that giving the power to the people may be the best way to save it.

Here are two examples: 

<h4><a href="http://sffireapp.org/" target="_blank">SF  Fire App</a></h4>

This is perhaps the best example of how people can help people. The app allows CPR-trained volunteers to get smartphone notifications of cardiac arrest patients who may be near them.

Developers used CityCampSF to work together and create another app to map Automated  External Defibrillator (AED) locations. This technology is critical  to help save lives, San Francisco City Attorney (and mayoral candidate)  Dennis Herrera said, and that information was not readily known before. 

<h4>Real World Sim City</h4>

One of the  things I tweeted during the Real World Sim City presentation was "It's amazing what can be crowdsourced -- learning about billboards, gov't  apps, even a Robocop statue in Michigan!" For some reason a spam account  picked up on that and commented, "I'd buy that for a dollar!" which  unknowingly played right into the ethos of the project. One of the ideas <a href="http://makeloveland.com/" target="_blank">Loveland  Technologies</a> Creative Director Jerry Paffendorf talked about was 'Inchvesting,' or paying a dollar per inch for vacant lots in downtown Detroit. Sure,  you can't do a lot with an inch, he said, but it gets people involved  and invested in their neighborhoods, and good things come from that. You've probably heard of another venture Paffendorf had a hand in â€“  the 10-foot bronze statue of Robocop enough people thought was a good idea that they donated $50,000 to make it happen on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.

The whole experience was symbolic of the Internet, he said. "Take something that's really serious, but put some kind of art experience on top. If you want to clean up the park, put a little Robocop on top of it."

There were so many excellent panels and so little time. There were people coding in the atrium, talking in the hallways and exchanging ideas and business cards in every corner. SF Director of Public Works Ed Reiskin said he applauded events like this, calling them the "next step forward in civic engagement."

"You ask, 'how can we empower people,' how  do we take the information the government has and make it work better, make it more useful, more accessible, in ways that we in government  didn't imagine," Reiskin said. "When you work in an organization you don't question some of the basic assumptions of why you do what you do. Coming in from the outside, having tech savviness, but also just being citizens, you make sure the government works for you, and that's tremendously powerful and helpful."
