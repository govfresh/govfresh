The White House will soon open a limited beta test to developers on a new <a href="http://petitions.whitehouse.gov/">We the People</a> Write API that allows third-party applications to submit information to official petitions.

"One of the things we've heard from the beginning is a strong desire from our users to be able to submit signatures and petitions from other sites -- and still receive an official response.  Up to this point, we haven't had a way to accept signatures submitted from other sites, but that is about to change," <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/04/write-api-we-people">writes</a> White House Associate Director of Online Engagement for the Office of Digital Strategy Ezra Mechaber.

According to the White House, more than 10 million users have signed nearly 300,000 petitions.

We the People was built in Drupal and the source code is <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petitions">available on GitHub</a>.

The Read API was opened earlier this year (<a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/how-why/api-gallery">sample projects here</a>).

While We the People is fairly intuitive and easy to use, there's huge potential for great designers and developers to essentially build a truly innovative and engaging platform.
