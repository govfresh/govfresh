The next iteration of Georgia.gov will be built using the open source platform Drupal.

<a href="http://www.phase2technology.com/">Phase2 Technology</a> announced it was awarded a contract to replace, migrate and support an overhaul of the state's website and content management system, which will be developed using Phase2's Drupal distribution <a href="http://www.phase2technology.com/">OpenPublic</a>. The company will partner with <a href="http://acquia.com">Acquia</a> and <a href="http://mediacurrent.com">Mediacurrent</a> to transition the current site from the Vignette CMS to Drupal.

"We are excited about the possibilities that Drupal brings to the state of Georgia,” said Georgia Chief Information Officer Calvin Rhodes. “This new platform will give us the flexibility to offer more online services to Georgians while making government more efficient and saving taxpayers money."
