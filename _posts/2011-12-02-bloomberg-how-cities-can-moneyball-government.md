New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg has a <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=8A9B9F00-C29C-7CA2-FA465E3F83FD7CD9">blog post</a> on how cities are collaborating to better leverage data analytics and maximize taxpayer return on investment. The post cites examples from major American cities and how they've leveraged data, especially 311 logs, to realize efficiencies.

Excerpt:

<blockquote>Data-driven analytics is the systematic use of information to find patterns of interest. For cities, this means looking inwards at the detailed data that city agencies continually collect – citizen complaints, licenses and permits, transactions, violations – and identifying new areas of high risk and high cost.

Cities can then respond to these findings by prioritizing the high impact areas appropriately. In the past, individual agencies have been limited in their ability to conduct large-scale analytics by mandate, scope, and organizational structure. City agencies across the country, which each already have a prescribed list of duties they must fulfill to keep the city running smoothly, often do not share data with one another, nor are they equipped analyze it. In an era of shrinking budgets, however, many cities, including New York, have made new efforts to solve this problem by creating teams existing specifically for the purpose of data investigation that can cross agency boundaries, with promising results. </blockquote>

My recommendation to Bloomberg and other mayors would be to <a href="http://govfresh.com/2010/03/open-government-means-open-analytics/" title="Open government means open analytics">open the analytics</a> to the public so that everyone has access and can contribute solutions. Perhaps a lesser concern, keeping this type of information private <a href="http://govfresh.com/2010/11/politicians-are-more-powerful-when-they-control-public-data/">gives incumbents insider information</a> when assessing what issues voters are most concerned about.

For those unfamiliar with the "Moneyball" premise and have't read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Michael-Lewis/dp/0393338398/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322805921&amp;sr=8-1">book</a> or seen the <a href="http://www.moneyball-movie.com/">movie</a>, here's a two-minute overview:
