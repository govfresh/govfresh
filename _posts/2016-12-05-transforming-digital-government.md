Earlier this year, 18F released a <a href="https://github.com/18F/transformation-research">preliminary report</a> on "what makes modern digital practices 'stick' within a government entity."

The findings provide an excellent overview of what constitutes digital government transformation, challenges and best practices for implementation.

From the report:

<h2>Characteristics</h2>

<blockquote><ol>
 	<li>People at all levels feel connected to the agency’s mission, have a sense of purpose, and are empowered with the autonomy to act on that purpose.</li>
 	<li>The agency chooses and manages technology effectively in the service of its larger mission.</li>
 	<li>The agency is capable of and committed to practicing continuous improvement.</li>
</ol></blockquote>

<h2>Barriers</h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Extreme technical debt</strong>, heavy enough to prevent small engineering teams from choosing their tools and doing rapid, iterative releases.</li>
 	<li><strong>Difficulty concretizing the benefits of transformation</strong>. We don’t say <em>quantifying</em>, because that’s the problem: many benefits are clear, but qualitative in nature. This makes it hard to get buy-in for ongoing work.</li>
 	<li><strong>Teams that can’t make project decisions without leadership approval</strong>. This costs time and effort for both management and staff, and makes it hard for transformative practices to become the norm.</li>
 	<li><strong>Failure to connect directly to users</strong> (whether they’re employees or the public). It’s harder to muster the will to seek out the most impactful practices when you don’t have a picture of the impacted people in your mind.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Best practices</h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Establishing constant feedback loops with users,</strong> often created by early, somewhat risky releases. These are powerful drivers of engagement at every possible level of the organization.</li>
 	<li><strong>Building cross-functional teams of substantial duration.</strong> Subject matter experts working side by side with technical specialists for months or years rather than weeks, and all being treated as full project team members.</li>
 	<li><strong>Using community organizing techniques to bring staff on board</strong> (like monthly meetings, office hours, councils). When it comes down to it, transformation is a long process of getting people on board and supporting them in hard work. This takes non-judgmental spaces to learn, celebrate small and large wins, and get support from teammates and management.</li>
 	<li><strong>Referring to authoritative guidance,</strong> like the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/techfar/">TechFAR Handbook</a>, <a href="https://management.cio.gov/implementation/">FITARA</a>, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf">Open Data Policy</a> (OMB Memorandum M-13-13), and the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">U.S. Digital Services Playbook</a>, helps tech-savvy managers make non-technical leadership comfortable allowing experiments in new practices.</li>
</ul>
