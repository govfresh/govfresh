Google has launched <a href="http://www.sidewalkinc.com/">Sidewalk Labs</a>, an "urban innovation company devoted to improving city life for residents, businesses and city governments, in particular by developing and incubating civic technologies."

Former Bloomberg LP CEO and New York City Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff will lead the new venture, which will be based in NYC.

“By improving urban technology, it’s possible to significantly improve the lives of billions of people around the world," Google CEO Larry Page said in a prepared statement.
