Denice Ross was named as U.S. chief data scientist at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

From the anouncement on her blog:

> The current moment is an extraordinary policy window for the Biden-Harris Administration to shore up our nation’s data infrastructure and reconfigure the public decision-making process so data scientists can best support the design and implementation of policies to improve the lives of all Americans.

> As I head into this new role as Chief Data Scientist, I’m focused on addressing these questions: What data do we need to design an equitable recovery? How will we use that data responsibly and to ensure we are building back better? What can we do to support the Federal, Tribal, state, and local data practitioners so they can help deliver better outcomes for the American people?

> The mission of the U.S. Chief Data Scientist is to responsibly unleash the power of data to benefit all Americans. I’m eager to get started and look forward to collaborating with data innovators already working inside of Federal government and at the State, Tribal, and local level.
