San Francisco will announce proposed revisions to open data legislation Monday that includes the creation of a chief data officer who will serve as the primary evangelist for making city data freely-available to the public.

As part of the new legislation (full text below), the CDO will "be responsible for sharing City data with the public, facilitating the sharing of information between City departments, and analyzing how data sets can be used to improve city decision making."

Also included is the requirement that each city agency appoint an open data coordinator and establish open data plans, implementation timelines and itemizations of what data is being collected.

“Open Data is an important resource for growing innovation,” said San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee in a prepared statement. “City-maintained datasets hold a wealth of value for citizens when they are liberated from the halls of government.  When data is freely accessible, it  increases government transparency and efficiency, while also driving civic innovation and job creation.”   

San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom first launched the city's open data efforts in 2009 through a centralized website, <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/">DataSF</a>. The site was enhanced in March 2012 and is now powered by the data platform startup <a href="http://Socrata.com">Socrata</a>.

<strong>Do NOT delete this NOTE: area.</strong></p>
<p>Be it ordained by the people of the City and County of San Francisco:</p>
<p>Section 1.  Findings.</p>
<p>(a)  San Francisco has been a leader in open data policy in the United States.  In 2009, Mayor Gavin Newsom issued an Executive Directive promoting Open Data.  In 2010, the Board of Supervisors expanded on the Directive with the passage of the City’s Open Data Policy (Ordinance 293-10), codified in San Francisco’s Administrative Code Section 22D.</p>
<p>(b)  An open data policy has been shown to drive increased government efficiency and civic engagement, leading to social and economic benefits as a result of innovative citizen interaction with government.  Social and economic benefits include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>(1)  Empowering citizens through democratization of information and fostering citizen participation in City projects;</p>
<p>(2)  Supporting early stage entrepreneurship;</p>
<p>(3)  Encouraging positive environments that contribute to workforce development and job creation; and</p>
<p>(4)  Increasing a positive business environment and promoting public-private partnerships.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(c) </span></em><em><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">City departments should take further steps to make their data sets available to the public in a more timely and efficient manner.</span></em><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">  San Francisco will improve and expand its Open Data Policy by creating the position of Chief Data Officer and Department Data Coordinators to implement the standards and policies articulated in the City’s Open Data Policy. </span></em></p>

In making this determination, COIT shall balance the benefits of open data set forth in Section 22D.1, above, with the need to protect from disclosure information that is proprietary, confidential, or protected by law or contract       (b)  <em><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Within 60 days of the effective date of this ordinance, COIT</span></em> <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The CDO</span></em>shall promulgate <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">and COIT shall adopt</span></em> rules and standards to implement the open data policy which shall apply to all Departments<em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">, consistent with COIT’s role and responsibilities in San Francisco Administrative Code Section 22A.3</span></em>.

<p>(3) <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rules for including open data requirements in applicable City contracts and standard contract provisions that promote the City&#8217;s open data policies, including, where appropriate, provisions to ensure that  the City retains ownership of City data and the ability to post the data on data.sfgov.org or make it available through other means; and,</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(4)  Requirements that a third party providing City data (or applications based on City data) to the public explicitly identify the source and version of the public data set, and include a description of any modifications made to the public data set.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(c)  COIT shall also evaluate the merits and feasibility of making City data sets available pursuant to a generic license, such as those offered by “Creative Commons.”  Such a license could grant any user the right to copy, distribute, display and create derivative works at no cost and with a minimum level of conditions placed on the use.  If appropriate, COIT shall specify the terms and conditions of such a generic license in the standards it develops it develops to implement the open data policy.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(d) Prior to issuing rules and standards, COIT shall solicit comments from the public, including from individuals and firms who have successfully developed applications using open data sets.</span></em></p></blockquote>
