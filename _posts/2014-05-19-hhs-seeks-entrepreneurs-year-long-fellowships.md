Created in 2010 and originally called the HHS Innovation Fellows Program, HHS Entrepreneurs was established "in response to difficulties in finding expertise and unique skill sets necessary to solve some of the critical challenges we face in health, health care, and the delivery of human services." The program was renamed HHS Entrepreneurs in 2012.
