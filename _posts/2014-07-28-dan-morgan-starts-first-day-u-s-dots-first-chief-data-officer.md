What has been known for weeks and already publicly celebrated by open data insiders was today formally acknowledged by the U.S. Department of Transportation in a Twitter retweet: Dan Morgan is the agency's new chief data officer.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Good morning, <a href="https://twitter.com/USDOT">@USDOT</a>! Excited to start my first day as your Chief Data Officer!</p>&mdash; Daniel Morgan (@dsmorgan77) <a href="https://twitter.com/dsmorgan77/statuses/493718779038150656">July 28, 2014</a></blockquote>

On an personal level, this is really special, not just because Dan (affectionately, and now officially, known as "Data Dan") is one of the smartest and most passionate people I know when it comes to using the power of data to solve transportation and safety issues, he is also pretty hilarious.

Congratulations to Dan, DOT and the United States of America.

The position was posted in <a href="http://govfresh.com/2014/06/usdot-seeks-chief-data-officer/">early June</a>.
