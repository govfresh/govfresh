"<a href="http://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/publications/behavioral-insights-for-making-cities-better/">Behavioral Insights for Cities</a>" offers anecdotes into how governments can improve constituent engagement by implementing smarter messaging and design into print collateral, email, texts and online interactions.

"By breaking down processes into micro-behaviors—the smallest steps that add up to make or break overall success—we can often strip out unnecessary ‘friction,’ increasing take-up of services as a result," says the report.

Example successes:

<blockquote><ul>
	<li>Reframing a letter increased business registrations for an online tax portal by 76%</li>
	<li>Reframing a letter increased online tax filing by 42%</li>
	<li>A letter telling businesses that the majority of their peers have an online account was twice as effective at boosting online tax filings than telling them to ‘Go Green’</li>
	<li>Adding a picture increased signups for charitable giving by over 220%</li>
	<li>Sending an email increased registrations for a public transportation pass by 11x</li>
	<li>Changing the message to emphasize different career benefits tripled the number of applicants to the police force (additionally, "The changed message was particularly effective in getting people of color &amp; women to apply")</li>
</ul></blockquote>

Published in October based on research from 25 cities, the report was produced by the <a href="http://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/">Behavioural Insights Team</a> as part of the Bloomberg Philanthropies’ <a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/">What Works Cities</a> initiative.
