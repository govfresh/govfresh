<h3>Committed to the Open Government Pledge for San Francisco?</h3>

Yes.

<h3>Open government statement</h3>

<blockquote>"Better policy is too important to leave to politicians alone. True Gov 2.0 must go beyond press releases and change how we elect leaders and how we hold them accountable. That's what Phil Ting's <a href="http://www.ResetSanFrancisco.org">www.ResetSanFrancisco.org</a> is all about ­– unlocking the power of User Generated Government to change how we campaign and how we govern."</blockquote>
