NASA's Technology Transfer Program published its [Spinoff 2022](https://spinoff.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-01/Spinoff.2022.pdf) issue that "tells the stories of companies, start-ups, and entrepreneurs transforming these innovations into cutting-edge products and services that boost the economy, protect the planet, and save lives."

From the [announcement](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-spinoffs-help-fight-coronavirus-clean-pollution-grow-food-more):

> Spinoff 2022 features more than 45 companies using NASA technology to advance manufacturing techniques, detoxify polluted soil, improve weather forecasting, and even clean the air to slow the spread of viruses, including coronavirus.

"These NASA technologies are not only giving companies and entrepreneurs a competitive edge in their own industries but are also helping to shape budding industries, such as commercial lunar landers," said Daniel Lockney, Technology Transfer program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington. "NASA is much more than rocket launches and astronauts. Weâ€™re about improving the quality of life for people all around the world."
