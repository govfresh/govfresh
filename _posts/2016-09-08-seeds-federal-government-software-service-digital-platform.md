With the release of a new identity management platform, 18F is slowly culling together all the requisite pieces for an easy-to-deploy, cloud-based federal government web management platform.

These include:

<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://cloud.gov/">cloud.gov</a> ("A platform by government developers, for government developers.")</li>
 	<li><a href="https://pages.18f.gov/identity-intro/">login.gov</a> ("Improving access to government services through a shared authentication platform")</li>
 	<li><a href="https://federalist.18f.gov/">Federalist</a> ("Federalist is a unified interface for publishing static government websites.")</li>
</ul>

These components, coupled with the <a href="https://standards.usa.gov/">U.S. Web Standards</a> that will allow for a common look and feel front-end theme and templates, the <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> for metrics, its work on security and <a href="https://https.cio.gov/">HTTPS</a>, the General Service Administration (via 18F) is on its way to becoming a full-scale software-as-a-service platform that makes it easy for agencies to launch and maintain web services in-house.
