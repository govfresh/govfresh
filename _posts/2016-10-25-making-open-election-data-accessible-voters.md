Having access to timely and comprehensive election data is fundamental to democracy. Knowing when and where to vote, as well as what your ballot options are is critical to being fully informed.

Googleâ€™s <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Civic Information API</a>, in partnership with the <a href="http://votinginfoproject.org/">Voter Information Project</a> and The Pew Charitable Trusts, makes this data easy for third parties to access and build applications on.

At ProudCity, we're now leveraging this data for a new app, <a href="https://proudcity.com/vote">ProudCity Vote</a>. ProudCity Vote makes it easy for anyone to quickly add comprehensive, timely voting and elections information to any website. Adding ProudCity Vote is free and easy as copying and pasting embed code onto any website page.

For example, <a href="https://san-rafael-ca.proudcity.com/vote/#/city/vote/address">see how San Rafael, Calif., is using ProudCity Vote</a>.

As many in the open data movement have noted, open data for the sake of open data is less useful than providing it in context of the user experience. We're excited to take this data and bring it directly to the residents of every city in America.
