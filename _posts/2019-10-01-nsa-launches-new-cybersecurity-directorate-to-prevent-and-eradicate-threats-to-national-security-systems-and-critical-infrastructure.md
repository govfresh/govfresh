<p>The National Security Agency announced the creation of a <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/what-we-do/cybersecurity/">new fifth domain-focused internal organization</a> that will "work to prevent and eradicate threats to national security systems and critical infrastructure, with an initial focus on the defense industrial  base and the improvement of our weapons’ security."</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/News-Stories/Article-View/Article/1973871/strengthening-the-front-line-nsa-launches-new-cybersecurity-directorate/">announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Cybersecurity Directorate will reinvigorate NSA’s white hat mission by sharing critical threat information and collaborating with partners and customers to better equip them to defend against malicious cyber activity. The new directorate will also better position NSA to operationalize its threat intelligence, vulnerability assessments, and cyberdefense expertise by integrating these efforts to deliver prioritized outcomes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Related, the NSA General Counsel Glenn Gerstell wrote an extensive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/opinion/nsa-privacy.html">editorial</a> for <em>The New York Times</em> calling for a more proactive approach to cyber resilience and a  concerted, proactive effort supporting the agency's online security efforts. Gerstell outlines four areas where policymakers must take note of.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The first is that the unprecedented scale  and pace of technological change will outstrip our ability to  effectively adapt to it. Second, we will be in a world of ceaseless and  pervasive cyberinsecurity and cyberconflict against nation-states,  businesses and individuals. Third, the flood of data about human and  machine activity will put such extraordinary economic and political  power in the hands of the private sector that it will transform the  fundamental relationship, at least in the Western world, between government and the private sector. Finally, and perhaps most ominously,  the digital revolution has the potential for a pernicious effect on the very legitimacy and thus stability of our governmental and societal  structures.</p></blockquote>
