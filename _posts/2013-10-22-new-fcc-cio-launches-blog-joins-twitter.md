From the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/blog/importance-communication">announcement</a>:

<blockquote>As I begin my journey as CIO, I also am open to the different views and perspectives of the FCC Bureaus and Offices who each have critical missions and IT needs that we will support to the best of our abilities. Also, and most importantly since we live in rapidly changing times both in terms of the pace of technology advances and the tightening of budgets in government, communication across both the public and private sector is crucial to the success of the FCC's IT endeavors. Through the power of communication and IT, we can transform what we can do together.
</blockquote>

Bray was appointed FCC CIO in July.
