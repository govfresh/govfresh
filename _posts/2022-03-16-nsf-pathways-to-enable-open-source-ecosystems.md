The National Science Foundation wants proposals to support a new agency program "to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance."

The program is called [Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose).

NSF will host an [informational webinar](https://www.nsf.gov/events/event_summ.jsp?cntn_id=304552&org=NSF) on March 23. [Register.](https://nsf.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_GDUveT2ZTBG4c-tNxaODoA)

From the [POSE website](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose):

> The purpose of the program is to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance. Many NSF-funded research projects result in publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable open-sourced software, hardware or data platforms that catalyze further innovation. In some cases, an open-source product is widely adopted and forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) comprises a distributed community of developers and a broad base of users across academia, industry and government. The goal of the POSE program is to fund new OSE managing organizations, each responsible for the creation and maintenance of infrastructure needed for efficient and secure operation of an OSE based around a specific open-source product or class of products. The early and intentional formation of such managing organizations is expected to ensure more secure open-source products, increased coordination of developer contributions, and a more focused route to impactful technologies.

> Importantly, the POSE program is not intended to fund the development of open-source research products, including tools and artifacts. The POSE program is also not intended to fund existing well-resourced open-source communities and ecosystems. Instead, the program aims to fund new managing organizations that catalyze community-driven development and growth of the subject OSEs. The expected outcomes of the POSE program are (1) to grow the community of researchers who develop and contribute to OSE efforts, and (2) to enable pathways for the development of collaborative OSEs that could lead to new technology products or services that have broad societal impacts. OSEs can stem from any areas of research supported by NSF.
