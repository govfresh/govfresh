Congratulations to New York City Chief Digital Officer <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/rachelsterne">Rachel Sterne</a> on her <a href="http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/tech-savvy-rachel-sterne/#1">Vogue magazine profile</a>.

I like this:

<blockquote>“She’s an intellectual heavyweight who’s as smart as—or smarter than—any guy in the room,” Sklar says. “And she’s ambitious, but she’s also really nice and gracious and poised. She’s a lady.” Half-joking, she adds, “She’s kind of our Kate Middleton.”</blockquote>

and this:

<blockquote>Sterne shares Bloomberg’s vision of turning New York into a tech hub that rivals Silicon Valley, but she understands that it won’t happen by opening factories that make computer chips. What matters now, she says, is the code—the digital language—that is quickly becoming the foundation of the city’s financial and cultural infrastructure. “Rachel is part of the generation that understands that code is literally the architecture of the future,” Rasiej says. “Code can solve problems, save money, make money, and advance humanity.</blockquote>
