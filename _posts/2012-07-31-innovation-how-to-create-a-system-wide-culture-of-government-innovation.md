Much of today's discussion around government innovation occurs in the context of the following:

<ul>
	<li>a designated role or department</li>
	<li>open data</li>
	<li>open source software</li>
	<li>crowdsourcing ideas</li>
	<li>challenges</li>
	<li>hackathons</li>
	<li>social media</li>
	<li>startups or technology in general</li>
	<li>a designated role or department speaking to other government employees about all or any of the above</li>
</ul>

While the above, when implemented successfully and sustainably, are great examples of how government is leveraging new thinking to implement better government, there's a general missed opportunity amongst civic innovation leaders related to fostering a system-wide culture of innovation.

You don't have to be an organizational expert, technology guru, chief innovation officer or work for NASA to win a gold medal in fostering civic innovation. (You definitely don't even need a <a href="http://ourpublicservice.org/OPS/publications/viewcontentdetails.php?id=208">study</a> or innovation score.)

Simply put, innovation is the ability to evaluate antiquated processes, rethink <em><strong>and execute</strong></em> a more efficient way of doing them. Often, the greatest innovations lie in simply not doing something anymore.

For those wanting to create a culture of government-wide innovation, here's a simple plan:

<ul>
	<li>create an "Innovation@" series</li>
	<li>spotlight an agency each month (ideally hosted at the respective agency)</li>
	<li>invite all government employees (and press) to attend</li>
	<li>begin with a 10-minute question-and-answer session between the agency/department head and senior-level government leader</li>
	<li>have designated agency employees give 5-minute presentations on how they created more efficient processes or stopped doing something (this does not include the agency/department head or the senior-level government leader)</li>
	<li>end with an open question and answer session</li>
	<li>do this every month</li>
	<li>do this forever</li>
</ul>

By implementing an "Innovation@" series, you create a perpetual system-wide culture of sharing, learning, celebrating and uniting all public workers in believing they can innovate and have a sense of pride in doing so.

In the process, you'll learn and do more for government innovation than you ever imagined.
