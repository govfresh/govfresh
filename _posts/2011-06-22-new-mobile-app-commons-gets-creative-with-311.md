TechPresident's Becky Kazansky <a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/meet-commons-mobile-social-gamification-311">has a great overview</a> of <a href="http://www.commonsthegame.com/">Commons</a>, a new 311 iPhone app that makes use of gaming and social features to better engage citizens. Here's a short video interview featuring one of its founders, Suzanne Kirkpatrick.

Kirkpatrick:

<blockquote>"It's exciting to be with other practitioners who are thinking about the idea of the relationship between technology and social change and civic empowerment, so we're glad to be part of that conversation. "</blockquote>
