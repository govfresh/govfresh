This is the start of the third year teaching teams of scientists (professors and their graduate students) in the <a href="http://steveblank.com/category/national-science-foundation/" target="_blank">National Science Foundation Innovation Corps</a> (I-Corps). This month we’ve crossed ~<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/" target="_blank">300 teams in the first two years</a> through the program.

I-Corps is the accelerator that helps scientists bridge the commercialization gap between their research in their labs and wide-scale commercial adoption and use.

<a href="http://steveblank.com/2011/12/20/the-government-starts-an-incubator-the-national-science-foundation-innovation-corps/" target="_blank">I-Corps bridges the gap between public support of basic science and private capital funding</a> of new commercial ventures. It’s a model for a government program that’s gotten the balance between public/private partnerships just right.

While a few of the I-Corps teams are in web/mobile/cloud, most are working on advanced technology projects that don’t make <a href="http://techcrunch.com/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>. You’re more likely to see their papers (in material science, robotics, diagnostics, medical devices, computer hardware, etc.) in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/" target="_blank">Science</a> or <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/%E2%80%8E" target="_blank">Nature</a>. The program pays scientists $50,000 to attend the program and takes no equity.

Currently there are 11 U.S. universities teaching the Lean LaunchPad curriculum organized as I-Corps “nodes” across the U.S.  The nodes are now offering their own regional versions of the Lean LaunchPad class under I-Corps.

The NSF I-Corps uses everything we know about building <a href="https://archive.harvardbusiness.org/cla/web/pl/product.seam?c=25903&amp;i=25905&amp;cs=f85785d3580feb87e2bce1535af10c2f" target="_blank">Lean Startups</a> and <a href="http://steveblank.com/2013/08/21/reinventing-life-science-startups-evidence-based-entrepreneurship-2/" target="_blank">Evidence-based Entrepreneurship</a> to connect innovation to entrepreneurship. It’s curriculum is built on a framework of business model design, customer development and agile engineering – and its emphasis on evidence, Lessons Learned versus demos, makes it the worlds most advanced accelerator. It’s success is measured not only by the technologies that leave the labs, but how many U.S. scientists and engineers we train as entrepreneurs and how many of them pass on their knowledge to students. I-Corps is our secret weapon to integrate American innovation and entrepreneurship into every U.S. university lab.

Every time I go to Washington and spend time at the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a> or <a href="http://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National Institute of Health</a> I’m reminded <a href="http://steveblank.com/2013/01/14/the-endless-frontier-u-s-science-and-national-industrial-policy-part-1/" target="_blank">why the U.S. leads the world in support of basic and applied science</a>.  It’s not just the money we pour into these programs (~$125 billion/year), but the people who have dedicated themselves to make the world a better place by <a href="http://steveblank.com/2012/03/26/the-national-science-foundation-innovation-corps-what-america-does-best/" target="_blank">advancing science and technology</a> for the common good.

I thought it was worth sharing the progress report from the Bay Area (Berkeley, Stanford, <a href="http://steveblank.com/category/life-sciences/" target="_blank">UCSF</a>) I-Corps node so you can see what just <em>one</em> of the nodes was accomplishing. Multiply this by the NSF regional nodes across the U.S. and you’ll have a feeling for the scale and breadth of the program.

Glad to a part of it.

<blockquote><strong>Lessons Learned</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The U.S. government has built an accelerator for scientists and engineers</li>
	<li>It’s scaled across the U.S.</li>
	<li>The program has taught ~300 teams</li>
	<li>Balance between public/private partnerships</li>
</ul>
