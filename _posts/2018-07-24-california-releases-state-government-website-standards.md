The California Department of Technology has published unified design standards and accompanying resources for official state government websites.

As part of this initiative, a new website, <a href="https://webstandards.ca.gov/">webstandards.ca.gov</a>, will serve as the foundation for "standards, code, functionality, implementation guidelines and best practices for Agencies/state entities to implement this policy," according to the <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/TL-18-04-Website-Standards_2018-0723.pdf">technology letter</a> announcing the standards.

More from the announcement:

<blockquote>As state government continues to expand access to online services, websites are an essential tool to interact with the public and deliver information to the people of California. The Website Standards policy ensures standardization and adoption of best practices to strengthen the security, usability, accessibility and quality of State of California websites. This policy will foster a consistent look and feel, and a common navigational framework across government, helping visitors recognize they are accessing official State of California information. This policy also promotes reasonable steps to design and develop websites that are accessible to people with disabilities and supports the adoption of usability principles that adhere to Californiaâ€™s usability standards for website development.</blockquote>
