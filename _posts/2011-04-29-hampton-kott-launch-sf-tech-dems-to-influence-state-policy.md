In my years of government reform advocacy, it's become exceedingly clear that political action and influence is  required to achieve the goals of the Gov 2.0 movement. Government  procurement and contracting is a mess; agile innovation and open data  lack policy framework; elected champions of civic technology and open  government are few and far between, and politicians often give little  more than lip service to principles of  transparency, collaboration, participation and efficiency in  government. It is essential for Gov 2.0 advocates to take on the  political system in terms of one-issue advocacy.

Kott is a tech policy enthusiast familiar with campaigns and the inner  workings of City Hall. She's also in the Emerge program, which trains  Democratic women to run for office - Emerge America is aiming to change this horrible statistic: the U.S. ranks 84 in the world for women in  elected office, behind China and Pakistan. Other charter officers of SF Tech Dems are <a href="http://twitter.com/jendrakesf" target="_blank">Jen Drake</a>, also a campaign and City Hall veteran, as VP of Creative, and Realtor and tech and marketing organizer and blogger <a href="http://twitter.com/jonathanfleming" target="_blank">Jonathan Fleming</a> as VP of Community  Affairs. Brigette  Hunley, chair of the California Democratic Party's Computer &amp;  Internet Caucus is the first member of the SF Tech Dems' Advisory Board.

"I  am honored to serve on the advisory board of SF Tech Dems, San Francisco's newest Democratic club," Hunley said. "This new club will  help the CDP Computer &amp; Internet caucus accomplish our mission on a  local level in the Bay Area."

The <a href="http://www.cdpic.org/index.php" target="_blank">CDP Internet Caucus</a> was  formed to harness the power of the internet and communication  technology to further Democratic ideals, issues, and legislation; to  assist Democratic Clubs and Assembly Districts; and to elect Democratic  candidates, and Hunley was reelected as chair in Sacramento on Friday  during the annual Democratic convention.

SF  Tech Dems will raise and spend funds to ensure that civic technology,  open  government and Gov 2.0 ideals are well-represented on the agendas of  Democratic candidates in San Francisco and California. The Tech Dems  will also endorse and sponsor legislation related to technology policy  and good governance. The  club will seek official party charter as a San Francisco organization,  and will hold its first in-person membership and fundraising drive in  late May.

"I  am proud to support the San Francisco Tech Dems," Ma said. "With  Silicon Valley as well as the other hubs all around California, we need  to do all we can to promote technology, to promote open technology, as  well as encouraging people to vote and to be educated on what happens in  California, how we generate revenue, how we are going to remain  competitive to ensure that we can get our of our fiscal crisis. Technology is one of the keys: we are a leader, we need to remain a leader."
