Last week at <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015">DrupalCon</a>, representatives from the city of Los Angeles, <a href="http://civicactions.com">CivicActions</a> and <a href="http://acquia.com">Acquia</a> shared their development and project management process to begin migrating and consolidating websites across 40 agencies to a single instance using <a href="https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-cloud-site-factory">Acquia Cloud Site Factory</a>.

The teams shared how they moved to the open source content management system Drupal, created a responsive web design theme, developed key features and integrated other services such as video and data.

The first sites included in the consolidation plan are <a href="http://www.lacity.org/">lacity.org</a> and <a href="http://lacityview.org/">lacityview.org</a>.

The presentation also includes a retrospective on goals achieved, areas of improvement and lessons learned. The city's LA team adopted agile development practices and, based on the success of the project, has been asked to train other agencies.

Project management and development tools used include <a href="https://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a>, <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">Google Hangouts</a> and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>.
