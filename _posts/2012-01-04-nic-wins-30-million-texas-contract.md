<a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2011/12/21/3331795/nic-adds-contract-worth-about.html">The Kansas City Star reports</a> e-gov services provider NIC won a $30-$35 million contract from the Texas Department of Public Safety. The contract runs through August 2016 and includes "motor vehicle inspection-related services, criminal history records, concealed handgun regulations and salvage regulation."

The Star also says "according to NIC, the work will require a 'significant investment' by the company to rebuild the state agencyâ€™s database."

That's one serious schema.
