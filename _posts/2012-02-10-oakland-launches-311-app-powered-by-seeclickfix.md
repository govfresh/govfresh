Oakland, Ca. is the latest major U.S. city to launch a 311 application that allows citizens to report issues directly to government from their smartphones. The service is powered by <a href="http://seeclickfix.com">SeeClickFix</a>. Details on how to download the app <a href="http://seeclickfix.com/apps">here</a>.

Oakland Mayor Jean Quan:

<blockquote>“With diminishing resources, this system can help City staff work more effectively and enlist more citizens to get involved. One of my favorite neighborhood leaders says that ’Grime equals Crime.’ Together we can make Oakland more beautiful and safer.”</blockquote>

Oakland Public Works Director Vitaly Troyan:

<blockquote>“This tool allows every person in Oakland to become the eyes and ears of the City. Problems can be reported more quickly and more accurately, and the system continues to follow the problem until it gets addressed."</blockquote>
