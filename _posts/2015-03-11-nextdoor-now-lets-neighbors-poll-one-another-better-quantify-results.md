The fast-growing, neighborhood-based community platform Nextdoor has launched a new feature, <a href="http://blog.nextdoor.com/2015/03/10/introducing-nextdoor-polls/">Nextdoor Polls</a>, that now allows neighbors to easily ask one another questions and quantify the results.

As <a href="https://nextdoor.com/agency/">governments</a> continue to integrate Nextdoor into their engagement strategies, polls will undoubtedly be a key feature in informally gauging public feedback on various issues. Given that many use the app for suggestions on services, this could also be leveraged by local businesses as a source for market research to learn more about what the community wants or how it could serve them better.

From Nextdoor's Morgan Hallmon:

<blockquote>"Polls work similarly to other newsfeed posts. They may be shared with the neighborhood, nearby neighborhoods, or any groups to which a member belongs. All responses to the poll are completely anonymous, which allows polls to be used for a wide variety of applications. Anyone who receives the poll may cast a single vote until the poll is closed, at which point the results are displayed for all members of the neighborhood or group."
</blockquote>

Nextdoor recently <a href="http://blog.nextdoor.com/2015/03/04/a-significant-milestone-and-the-journey-ahead/">raised an additional $100 million</a> in investment that puts its valuation at $1.1 billion.
