The Public Technology Institute <a href="http://www.pti.org/index.php/ptiee1/more/whats_out_and_whats_in">released its list</a> of "What’s Out and What’s In?" technology predictions for 2012 based on interviews with local government IT executives and vendors who service city and county governments.

For the most part, the lists are no-brainers with the exception of "CIO as Chief Innovation Officer" and "Mobile apps for information" trends.

As <a href="http://govfresh.com/2011/09/does-government-innovation-need-its-own-department/">I've written before</a>, innovation shouldn't be departmentalized or pegged to one person, but should be encouraged based on clearly defined roles and objectives. As far as mobile applications are concerned, they'll proliferate, but lean, smart governments will begin to build mobile-friendly websites or open their data for others to develop off, rather than invest in separate platforms and build multiple applications in-house.

Any comments on the predictions?
