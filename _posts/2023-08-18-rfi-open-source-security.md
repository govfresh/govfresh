## Dates

## Key excerpts

From the [White House fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2023/08/10/fact-sheet-office-of-the-national-cyber-director-requests-public-comment-on-open-source-software-security-and-memory-safe-programming-languages/):

> ONCD has established an Open-Source Software Security Initiative (OS3I) to champion the adoption of memory safe programming languages and open-source software security. The security and resiliency of open-source software is a national security, economic, and a technology innovation imperative. Because open-source software plays a vital and ubiquitous role across the Federal Government and critical infrastructure, (1) vulnerabilities in open-source software components may cause widespread downstream detrimental effects. The Federal Government recognizes the immense benefits of open-source software, which enables software development at an incredible pace and fosters significant innovation and collaboration. In light of these factors, as well as the status of open-source software as a free public good, it may be appropriate to make open-source software a national public priority to help ensure the security, sustainability, and health of the open-source software ecosystem. 

From the [RFI](https://www.regulations.gov/document/ONCD-2023-0002-0001):

> The RFI aims to further the work of OS3I by identifying areas most appropriate to focus government priorities, and addressing critical questions such as:
> 
> - How should the Federal Government contribute to driving down the most important systemic risks in open-source software?
> - How can the Federal Government help foster the long-term sustainability of open-source software communities?
> - How should open-source software security solutions be implemented from a technical and resourcing perspective?

> We hope that potential respondents will view this RFI as a civic opportunity to help shape the government's thinking about open-source software security.
