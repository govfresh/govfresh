<a href="http://change.org">Change.org</a> announced it will host a <a href="http://www.hackforchange.com/">Hack for Change</a> contest June 17-18 to build "apps for social good." The event will be held at Change.org's San Francisco headquarters. Winners will receive $10,000 in seed funding.

The contest, held in partnership with <a href="http://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com">Mashable</a>, "looks to accelerate a growing movement of using the web to transform advocacy, philanthropy, government, and politics."

“The San Francisco Bay Area is home to the world’s top web designers and developers -- many of whom would like to use their skills for social change, but have not been asked,” said Ben Rattray, the founder of Change.org. “Hack for Change is looking to tap into the tech community to help build apps that change lives and to provide an easy first step into the technology-for-good movement.”
