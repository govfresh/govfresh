How To Citizen with Baratunde reimagines “citizen” as a verb and reminds us how to wield our collective power. Learn new perspectives and practices from people working to improve society for the many.

From the "How to Citizen" website:

> Hello. I’m Baratunde Thurston, creator and host of the podcast How To Citizen with Baratunde. I wanted to make this show because, honestly, I’m tired. I’m tired of feeling powerless. I’m tired of only hearing how broken the world is. And I’m tired of leaders asking so little of those of us with so much and asking so much of those of us with so little.

> So we made a podcast and now this site to remind ourselves that the word “citizen” is so much more than a noun we use to draw lines between people. Citizen is also a verb. Citizen isn’t what you are; it’s how you are. If this resonates with you, you’re in the right place. Join me, and let’s develop our citizen practice together.
