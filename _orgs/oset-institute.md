The OSET Institute is about researching, developing, and making innovative public election technology (i.e., publicly available open source technology subject to an OSI-accredited license for production uses, and AGPL3 for all other research and some production applications) in order to increase verification, accuracy, security, and transparency (in process), and ensure that ballots are counted as cast.
