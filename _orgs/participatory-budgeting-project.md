The Participatory Budgeting Project (PBP) is a nonprofit organization that empowers people to decide together how to spend public money, primarily in the US and Canada. We create and support participatory budgeting processes that deepen democracy, build stronger communities, and make public budgets more equitable and effective.

PBP is the lead organization advancing participatory budgeting (PB) across the United States and Canada. We have empowered more than 400,000 people to directly decide how to spend $300 million in public funds in 29 cities.
