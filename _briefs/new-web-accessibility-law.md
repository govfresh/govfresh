## TLDR üí•



* A new federal law mandates local government digital content be accessible to everyone. 
* This includes websites, mobile apps, forms, PDFs, social media, and more.


## Why it matters üö®



* 1 in 4 Americans live with some type of disability. 
* Over 12% of adults have a cognitive disability, like autism, attention deficit, and dyslexia.
* Non-compliance puts your agency at risk for lawsuits.
* [People don‚Äôt like PDFs.](https://deptofcivicthings.com/why-governments-should-get-rid-of-pdf-documents/)


## What they say üí¨ 

[U.S. Department of Justice:](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-publish-final-rule-strengthen-web-and-mobile-app-access-people)



* ‚ÄúFor far too long, people with disabilities have been left behind as we've witnessed more services and government activity increasingly move online.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThe rule, which clarifies the standards for making mobile apps and websites accessible, is vital to people‚Äôs ability to use and benefit from public programs and services.‚Äù

[Civil Rights Division, U.S. Department of Justice:](https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/)



* ‚ÄúSometimes, inaccessible websites and mobile apps can keep people with disabilities from joining or fully participating in civic or other community events like town meetings or programs at their child‚Äôs school.‚Äù


## What is web accessibility? ü§î 



* Online content that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use and understand. 
* Includes people with visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.


### 4 key principles (aka POUR)


#### Perceivable

Users must be able to perceive the information.

Examples:



* Text descriptions for images so screen readers can convey what‚Äôs shown.
* Captioning on videos for people with hearing impairments.


#### Operable

Users should be able to navigate and interact with content.

This includes:



* Keyboard-friendly navigation for users who can‚Äôt use a mouse.
* Clear and consistent navigation to make finding information easier.


#### Understandable

Content should be readable and intuitive. 

This can involve:



* Simple, [plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) and clear instructions.
* Predictable website layouts to reduce confusion.


#### Robust

Content must work with various technologies, including assistive devices.

Examples:



* Code that‚Äôs compatible with screen readers, voice recognition, and other tools.
* Regular updates to ensure compatibility with evolving tech standards.


## WCAG: the web accessibility acronym ü§ì

The new law requires websites and digital content to meet [WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1).

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is an international standard. [Versions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#versions) evolve over time. Each guideline has 3 levels of success criteria: A, AA, and AAA.


## Elephant in the new law: PDFs üêò

The [new law includes making sure PDFs (and other documents) are accessible](https://deptofcivicthings.com/the-elephant-in-the-new-accessibility-law-pdfs/).

Most governments have thousands of PDFs online. It‚Äôs time consuming and expensive to make them accessible.

Governments should:



* Default to web text, wherever possible.
* Set standards for when an accessible PDF is allowed.


### What makes a PDF accessible



* Selectable and resizable text
* Sequential headings
* Tags
* Logical reading order
* Alt text for images and graphics
* Fillable form fields
* Properly formatted tables
* Sufficient color contrast

* [Accessibility training, tools, and events](https://www.section508.gov/training/) (General Services Agency)


## Federal digital accessibility üèõÔ∏è 

[Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires federal agencies make their online information accessible to people with disabilities. They help agencies meet accessibility laws with:



* Policies
* Purchasing
* Content
* Design and development
* Testing
* Trainings
