**Because all government websites** in America **should end with '.gov'**. ![U.S. flag icon](/assets/img/icons/flag-us.png "U.S. flag icon") ![Classical building icon](/assets/img/icons/classical-building.png "Classical building icon") ![Desktop computer icon](/assets/img/icons/desktop-computer.png "Desktop computer icon")

And by **all**, we mean … 

**Every. Single. Government. Website.** ![100 points icon](/assets/img/icons/100.png "100 points icon")

Do you **have an official government website** that **isn’t a .gov**? ![Eyes icon](/assets/img/icons/eyes.png "Eyes icon")

If not, we know what you're thinking. ![Thinking face icon](/assets/img/icons/thinking-face.png "Thinking face icon")

**“We don’t need a .gov.”** ![Face with raised eyebrow icon](/assets/img/icons/face-with-raised-eyebrow.png "Face with raised eyebrow icon")

**“It’s too much work.”** (nope)

**“It’s too technical.”** (if tiny towns can do it ...) ![Nerd face icon](/assets/img/icons/nerd-face.png "Nerd face icon")

**“It costs too much.”** (it’s FREE) ![Backhand index pointing right icon](/assets/img/icons/backhand-index-pointing-right.png "Backhand index pointing right icon") ![FREE icon](/assets/img/icons/free.png "FREE icon")

Hear us out. ![Ear icon](/assets/img/icons/ear.png "Ear icon")

Increasingly, there’s **all this cybersecurity nonsense** going on that the average person can't make sense of. ![Locked icon](/assets/img/icons/locked.png "Locked icon") ![Person shrugging icon](/assets/img/icons/person-shrugging.png "Person shrugging icon")

**Phishing, ransomware, viruses, fake news.** ![Fishing pole icon](/assets/img/icons/fishing-pole.png "Fishing pole icon") ![Microbe icon](/assets/img/icons/microbe.png "Microbe icon")

**Nobody has time for that.** ![No entry icon](/assets/img/icons/no-entry.png "No entry icon") ![Timer clock icon](/assets/img/icons/timer-clock.png "Timer clock icon")

People are confused as ![Hell](/assets/img/icons/angry-face-with-horns.png "Angry face with horns icon") .

**.gov is government’s first line of defense** in cutting through all the security noise. ![Flexed biceps icon](/assets/img/icons/flexed-biceps.png "Flexed biceps icon")

**.gov verifies you’re legit**, because only official government entities can get a .gov. ![Classical building icon](/assets/img/icons/classical-building.png "Classical building icon") ![Check mark icon](/assets/img/icons/check-mark.png "Check mark icon")

**We need all governments** – local and national – **to show we’re united** and **not messing around** anymore when it comes to **keeping Americans safe online**. ![U.S. flag icon](/assets/img/icons/flag-us.png "U.S. flag icon") ![Locked icon](/assets/img/icons/locked.png "Locked icon")

If every government website in America was .gov, the general public would know:

**“I’m on a government website. I trust this. They’ve got my back. I’m good to go.”** ![U.S. flag icon](/assets/img/icons/flag-us.png "U.S. flag icon") ![Heart hands icon](/assets/img/icons/heart-hands.png "Heart hands icon")

We know what you’re thinking:

**“This totally makes sense. We’re going .gov ASAP. What do we do now?”** ![Thinking face icon](/assets/img/icons/thinking-face.png "Thinking face icon")

Here’s the **.gov 411**. ![Details icon](/assets/img/icons/details.png "Details icon")

The **[DotGov](https://home.dotgov.gov/)** program is the service **U.S. government entities use to get and manage their .gov domains**. ![Cursor icon](/assets/img/icons/cursor.png "Cursor icon")

This includes:

**Federal, state, local, territorial governments** or other **publicly controlled entities**.

**Tribal governments** recognized by the U.S. government (federal or state).

**[DotGov](https://home.dotgov.gov/)** is managed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's **[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/)** (AKA **[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)**). ![U.S. flag icon](/assets/img/icons/flag-us.png "U.S. flag icon") ![Locked icon](/assets/img/icons/locked.png "Locked icon")

And you know if they’re in charge, **they're not messing around**.

Does your **government website need a .gov ASAP**? ![Eyes icon](/assets/img/icons/eyes.png "Eyes icon")

**If yes,** show your community **you’re .gov united**, and that **you're not messing around**. ![Collision icon](/assets/img/icons/collision.png "Collision icon")

**[Get your .gov](https://home.dotgov.gov/) today**. ![U.S. flag icon](/assets/img/icons/flag-us.png "U.S. flag icon") ![Classical building icon](/assets/img/icons/classical-building.png "Classical building icon") ![Desktop computer icon](/assets/img/icons/desktop-computer.png "Desktop computer icon")
