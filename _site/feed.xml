&lt;p&gt;In-Q-Tel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iqt.org/open-source-software-nutrition-labels-an-ai-assurance-application/&quot;&gt;asks&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If software developers and software program managers had access to information about the health and security of specific open source software packages – like shoppers in a grocery store looking at food nutrition labels – would they be empowered to make better choices about which software packages to use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, In-Q-Tel created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://trui4.csb.app/&quot;&gt;nutrition label for FakeFinder&lt;/a&gt;, an open source tool that analyzes whether a video contains deepfakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indicators used for the label include package totals for contributors, maintainers, dependencies and versions, as well as license type, funding resources, package health scores and days since last release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code for the OSS nutrition label is available at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/IQTLabs/OSSNutritionLabelPrototypes&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke Fretwell</name></author><category term="[&quot;Open&quot;]" /><summary type="html">In-Q-Tel built a “nutrition label” prototype that gives developers insight into the health of open source software packages.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Citizen satisfaction with federal government services drops to all-time low</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/radar/2021-asci-federal-government-report" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Citizen satisfaction with federal government services drops to all-time low" /><published>2022-01-25T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-01-25T17:37:09-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/radar/2021-asci-federal-government-report</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/radar/2021-asci-federal-government-report">&lt;p&gt;Results from the annual American Customer Satisfaction Index survey say public satisfaction with U.S. federal government services is down 2.6% to 63.4%, the lowest rating ever recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are based on interviews with 2,387 people who were asked to evaluate their 2021 experiences with federal government services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theacsi.org/news-and-resources/customer-satisfaction-reports/reports-2021/acsi-federal-government-report-2021&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ACSI federal government model measures four primary drivers of citizen satisfaction that are quality attributes which represent the most relevant performance areas of government agencies and services. Among these drivers of satisfaction, all four decline between 2020 and 2021: efficiency and ease of government processes (-5% to 63), ease of accessing and clarity of information (-3% to 67), the courtesy and professionalism of customer service (-1% to 73), and perceptions of government website quality (-1% to 70). Collectively, these declines represent a broad erosion of the quality of federal government services experienced by citizens in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satisfaction by political affiliation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Looking at year-over-year trends from 2020 to 2021 by party affiliation, both Democrats (-4% to 65) and Republicans (-2% to 64) show declines in citizen satisfaction. The relatively small group of “Other Party” supporters (-13% to 54) also expresses much lower satisfaction in 2021 although this group’s smaller sample size yields greater year-to-year variability. Only Independents who indicate no political party affiliation (+2% to 63) show a small increase in satisfaction for 2021. Nevertheless, the broad decline in citizen satisfaction across all respondents who indicate a political affiliation—including Democrats, Republicans, and Other Party supporters—reinforces the existence of a widespread erosion in the perceived quality of government output across citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the White House Open Source Software Security Summit, a senior administration official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberscoop.com/white-house-log4j-open-source-software-security/&quot;&gt;told CyberScoop&lt;/a&gt;, “Building on the Log4j incident, the objective of this meeting is to facilitate an important discussion to improve the security of open source software — and to brainstorm how new collaboration could rapidly drive improvements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to CyberScoop, the full tech participant list included Akamai, Amazon, Apache Software Foundation, Apple, Cloudflare, Facebook/Meta, GitHub, Google, IBM, Linux Open Source Foundation, Microsoft, Oracle, RedHat and VMware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the National Institute of Standards and Technology is working to gather ideas from technology and open source communities on how best to work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“NIST intends to soon release a Request for Information asking stakeholders – people like you – how it can improve its cybersecurity efforts,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commerce.gov/news/speeches/2022/01/remarks-us-commerce-secretary-gina-m-raimondo-white-house-open-source&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Raimondo. “This will help ensure that NIST is partnering effectively with both the private and public sectors on cybersecurity, including open-source software.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies and organizations released statements expressing their commitment to collaborating with government to build stronger communities related to open source security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The open source ecosystem will need to work together to further cybersecurity research, training, analysis and remediation of defects found in critical open source software projects. These plans were met with positive feedback and a growing, collective commitment to take meaningful action. Following the recent log4j crisis, the time has never been more pressing for public and private collaboration to ensure that open source software components and the software supply chains they flow through demonstrate the highest cybersecurity integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We see tremendous opportunity ahead to help the community realize a safer and more secure future for software. Through partnerships with governments, academia, developers, and other organizations, we can better protect and support the developers and software that power our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many leading companies and organizations don’t recognize how many parts of their critical infrastructure depend on open source. That’s why it’s essential that we see more public and private investment in keeping that ecosystem healthy and secure. … Given the importance of digital infrastructure in our lives, it’s time to start thinking of it in the same way we do our physical infrastructure. Open source software is a connective tissue for much of the online world — it deserves the same focus and funding we give to our roads and bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klau says the state made the portal code base publicly available for re-use, and Washington state re-purposed it for its own vaccine records website. The state is working with other states to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techblog.cdt.ca.gov/2022/01/californians-have-downloaded-over-11-million-digital-vaccine-records/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In September 2021, we released all of the code we wrote for our DCVR Portal to the public domain. Our hope at the time was that other states might take our code and implement their own system for their residents. Less than two months later, Washington State did just that, releasing WAVerify to enable Washington residents to retrieve their own digital vaccine record. Washington went a step further, making a number of improvements to our code, including adding dozens of additional translations to make the service more accessible for additional communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we look ahead to 2022, we’re in touch with another six states who plan on following Washington’s lead, bringing code originally developed in California to even more Americans in the next few months. We put together a playbook that documented some of what we learned this year as we built and shipped the DCVR Portal, and expect other states may find it instructive as they explore doing something similar to what we did in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the playbook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;CDOs must seize opportunities to leverage data as a strategic asset within their
organization, otherwise, the CDO faces the risk of becoming a compliance driven
position. The CDO should first focus on finding opportunities to promote
the sharing and access of data within their agencies. They must build critical
relationships and show value in the near-term through “quick wins,” as data
governance and master data management programs take longer to implement
and demonstrate results. It is a hard job with a value proposition not consistently
appreciated and with challenges that are critical to overcome to properly serve their stakeholders and the American people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;NASA requested public feedback about how it can provide underserved communities with equal access to the opportunities the agency creates. NASA specifically asked for feedback on possible opportunities to leverage NASA assets to help underserved communities, and barriers to accessing current NASA grants, programs, and procurements.

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations were published in a report, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105388&quot;&gt;Digital Services: Considerations for a Federal Academy to Develop a Pipeline of Digital Staff&lt;/a&gt;, based on an October 2021 roundtable made up of “chief technology officers, chief data officers, chief information officers, and those in similar roles across the federal government, as well as knowledgeable representatives from academia and nonprofits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This report summarizes the perspectives that selected technology leaders shared on (1) federal workforce needs for digital services staff, (2) key characteristics of a digital service academy, and (3) considerations to help ensure federal agencies can absorb graduates of a digital service academy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One potential method for developing digital services staff, discussed by the roundtable participants, is the creation of a digital service academy—similar to military academies—to train future civil servants in the digital skills needed to modernize government. Considerations for a digital service academy include the kinds of skills that would be taught and the composition and size of a graduating class, according to roundtable participants. Further, they said digital services staff would need proficiency in both digital skills as well understanding the functions of government to meet agencies’ needs.&lt;/p&gt;
