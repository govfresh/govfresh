&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The CX CoE has created this framework to help organizations transform their federal service delivery. It is designed to provide organizations with a deeper understanding of how to measure their maturity level, and tactics to get to the next level. Although the CX Maturity Model does not represent or constitute official guidance, it can help you take your organization’s CX Maturity to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the announcement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bringing all these teams into one office will strengthen everyone. CalData knows how to empower data-driven decisions. CalInnovate helps state departments improve the design and delivery of services they provide. The GET Center pilots ways to improve state operations. Each fuels the other and by combining forces we can do even more great work for Californians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the announcement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;GOV.UK PaaS was set up in 2015, to help public sector organisations quickly and securely host their digital services without worrying about infrastructure. However, 7 years is a long time in tech and things have changed. The big cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP and others) have upped their game and reduced the barriers to entry for digital teams. Over the same period departments have built better and more expert in-house cloud engineering capability, and are (broadly) clustering around a Kubernetes based architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;GOV.UK PaaS has not seen the rapid and continued growth that we’ve seen with some of our other platform products, and is now at a point where we either invest heavily in some significant technical architecture changes, or we make the difficult decision to sunset the product. We have decided to do the latter, and GOV.UK PaaS will be decommissioned over the next 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cybersecurity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IT modernization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Digital-first customer experience&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Technology powers the Federal Government’s ability to deliver on its mission. This Administration is leading a unified IT operating plan that centers on the American people and gives them a Government that understands who they are, what they need, and how best to deliver services to them efficiently, effectively, and equitably, with accessibility and respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Linux Foundation and the Open Source Software Security Foundation (OpenSSF) brought together over 90 executives from 37 companies and government leaders from the NSC, ONCD, CISA, NIST, DOE, and OMB to to reach a consensus on key actions to take to improve the resiliency and security of open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies – including Amazon, Ericsson, Google, Intel, Microsoft and VMWare – pledged $30 million to “rapidly advance well-vetted solutions to the ten major problems the plan identifies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan calls for $150 million in funding over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/radar/white-house-open-source-security-summit&quot;&gt;first open source security summit&lt;/a&gt; was convened by the White House in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose&quot;&gt;Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NSF will host an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/events/event_summ.jsp?cntn_id=304552&amp;amp;org=NSF&quot;&gt;informational webinar&lt;/a&gt; on March 23. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nsf.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_GDUveT2ZTBG4c-tNxaODoA&quot;&gt;Register.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose&quot;&gt;POSE website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The purpose of the program is to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance. Many NSF-funded research projects result in publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable open-sourced software, hardware or data platforms that catalyze further innovation. In some cases, an open-source product is widely adopted and forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) comprises a distributed community of developers and a broad base of users across academia, industry and government. The goal of the POSE program is to fund new OSE managing organizations, each responsible for the creation and maintenance of infrastructure needed for efficient and secure operation of an OSE based around a specific open-source product or class of products. The early and intentional formation of such managing organizations is expected to ensure more secure open-source products, increased coordination of developer contributions, and a more focused route to impactful technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Importantly, the POSE program is not intended to fund the development of open-source research products, including tools and artifacts. The POSE program is also not intended to fund existing well-resourced open-source communities and ecosystems. Instead, the program aims to fund new managing organizations that catalyze community-driven development and growth of the subject OSEs. The expected outcomes of the POSE program are (1) to grow the community of researchers who develop and contribute to OSE efforts, and (2) to enable pathways for the development of collaborative OSEs that could lead to new technology products or services that have broad societal impacts. OSEs can stem from any areas of research supported by NSF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the January 24 &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/SoftwareDev-OpenSource.pdf&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Department must follow an “Adopt, Buy, Create” approach to software preferentially adopting existing government or OSS solutions before buying proprietary offerings, and only creating new non-commercial software when no off-the-shelf solutions are adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a direct avenue for the department to tap into a worldwide community of developers to collectively speed up and strengthen the software development process,” said the Defense Deparment at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Modern software is open sourced software (OSS),” says the Defense Department on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.mil/&quot;&gt;Code.mil&lt;/a&gt; website. “The creative contribution of individual developers to help solve complex problems of impact is largely untapped by DoD.

&lt;p&gt;About the project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to connect government services to Californians who need them most. We have to consider a wide range of experiences, abilities, education, and technical literacy. With the State of California’s Design System, we help make digital information and services easier to use. The Design System increases equity, unity, compassion, and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of the design system was first initiated by the state’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;Alpha project&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Alpha was the first effort to reimagine how government understands, builds and provides digital services. The primary goal was to create a better digital experience for all Californians. The CA.gov Alpha team adopted agile principles allowing them to quickly iterate on feedback while blogging their story out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;California Design System&lt;/a&gt; includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/principles/&quot;&gt;design principles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/style/content/&quot;&gt;content and design guides&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/components/&quot;&gt;component library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
