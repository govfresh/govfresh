From the publisher:

> What are we doing to ourselves when we tell ourselves we're Consumers 3000 times a day?

> What would it look like to put the same creativity and energy into involving people as Citizens?

> What would you do in this time, if you truly believed in yourself and those around you?

> Jon Alexander spent the first decade of his career in the advertising industry, selling some of the world's biggest brands. Then he realised he was caught up in a story he didn't believe in â€“ the Consumer Story.

> Here, with New York Times bestselling writer Ariane Conrad, he shows us what we need to do to step into a bigger idea of ourselves: as collaborative, caring, creative Citizens who can shape our communities, organisations, and nations for the better.
