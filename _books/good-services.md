From the publisher:

> Most of the services we use every day aren’t designed to meet our needs. In fact, most of the services we use every day weren’t designed at all

> In the rush to create new and innovative experiences, services today have overlooked the one crucial thing we need from them: to be able to do what we set out to do with as little friction as possible

> This is book is not about ‘great services’, ‘unique services’, ‘thrilling’ or ‘magical’ services. It won’t tell you how to ‘wow’ your users with something they didn’t expect, or build something that the world has never seen before

> This book will tell you how to design a service that your users can find, understand and use without having to ask for help 

> It will tell you how to not disappoint your users, and make sure they can do the thing they set out to do

> In a nutshell, it will help you to make services that work
