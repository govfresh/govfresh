I"F<p>As part of the Governor Gavin Newsom’s 2021-22 budget, the California Department of Technology has received $25 million in funding “to demonstrate how investments in agile IT solutions can rapidly improve government services.”</p>

<p>The resourcing is part of round two of the <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/tmf/">CDT technology modernization fund</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Innovation and speed are terms that are too rarely applied in government,” said CDT <a href="https://techblog.cdt.ca.gov/2022/03/technology-modernization-fund-tmf-round-two-now-open/">blog</a>. “The TMF works to proactively invest in projects that modernize digital services for residents and state employees. Since its launch, the TMF has delivered quick results – four projects received immediate funding to kickstart improvements that directly benefit Californians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, round two of the innovative grant process opens – state entities may now submit proposals through April 8. Projects must have clear, concrete goals, a viable and quick path to delivery, and strong support from the requesting entity’s executive leadership.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated based on their probability of success, replicability, and support of statewide goals.</p>
