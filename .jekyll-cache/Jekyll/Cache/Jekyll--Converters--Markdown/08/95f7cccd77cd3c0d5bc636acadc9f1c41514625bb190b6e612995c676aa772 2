I"-<p>The Federal Chief Data Officers Council <a href="https://www.cdo.gov/news/celebrating-2021/">shared</a> its 2021 accomplishments and published a playbook to help CDOs “lead data-driven transformation” within their agencies.</p>

<p>From the playbook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CDOs must seize opportunities to leverage data as a strategic asset within their
organization, otherwise, the CDO faces the risk of becoming a compliance driven
position. The CDO should first focus on finding opportunities to promote
the sharing and access of data within their agencies. They must build critical
relationships and show value in the near-term through “quick wins,” as data
governance and master data management programs take longer to implement
and demonstrate results. It is a hard job with a value proposition not consistently
appreciated and with challenges that are critical to overcome to properly serve their stakeholders and the American people.</p>
