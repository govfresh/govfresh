I"[<p>California Chief Technology Innovation Officer Rick Klau reports that 6.5 million residents have downloaded more than 11 million digital vaccine records from the state’s <a href="https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/">vaccine record portal</a>.</p>

<p>Klau says the state made the code base for the portal publicly available and Washington state re-purposed it for its own vaccine records website.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In September 2021, we released all of the code we wrote for our DCVR Portal to the public domain. Our hope at the time was that other states might take our code and implement their own system for their residents. Less than two months later, Washington State did just that, releasing WAVerify to enable Washington residents to retrieve their own digital vaccine record. Washington went a step further, making a number of improvements to our code, including adding dozens of additional translations to make the service more accessible for additional communities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we look ahead to 2022, we’re in touch with another six states who plan on following Washington’s lead, bringing code originally developed in California to even more Americans in the next few months. We put together a playbook that documented some of what we learned this year as we built and shipped the DCVR Portal, and expect other states may find it instructive as they explore doing something similar to what we did in California.</p>
