I"¥<p>Results from the annual American Customer Satisfaction Index survey indicates the public satisfaction with the federal government services is down 2.6% to 63.4%, the lowest rating ever recorded.</p>

<p>The results are based on interviews with 2,387 users who were asked to evaluate their recent experiences with federal government services.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.theacsi.org/news-and-resources/customer-satisfaction-reports/reports-2021/acsi-federal-government-report-2021">announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ACSI federal government model measures four primary drivers of citizen satisfaction that are quality attributes which represent the most relevant performance areas of government agencies and services. Among these drivers of satisfaction, all four decline between 2020 and 2021: efficiency and ease of government processes (-5% to 63), ease of accessing and clarity of information (-3% to 67), the courtesy and professionalism of customer service (-1% to 73), and perceptions of government website quality (-1% to 70). Collectively, these declines represent a broad erosion of the quality of federal government services experienced by citizens in 2021.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Satisfaction by political affiliation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking at year-over-year trends from 2020 to 2021 by party affiliation, both Democrats (-4% to 65) and Republicans (-2% to 64) show declines in citizen satisfaction. The relatively small group of ‚ÄúOther Party‚Äù supporters (-13% to 54) also expresses much lower satisfaction in 2021 although this group‚Äôs smaller sample size yields greater year-to-year variability. Only Independents who indicate no political party affiliation (+2% to 63) show a small increase in satisfaction for 2021. Nevertheless, the broad decline in citizen satisfaction across all respondents who indicate a political affiliation‚Äîincluding Democrats, Republicans, and Other Party supporters‚Äîreinforces the existence of a widespread erosion in the perceived quality of government output across citizens.</p>
