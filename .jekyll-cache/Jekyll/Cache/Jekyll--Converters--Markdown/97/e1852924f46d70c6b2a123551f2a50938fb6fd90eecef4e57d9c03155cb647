<blockquote>
  <p>The open source ecosystem will need to work together to further cybersecurity research, training, analysis and remediation of defects found in critical open source software projects. These plans were met with positive feedback and a growing, collective commitment to take meaningful action. Following the recent log4j crisis, the time has never been more pressing for public and private collaboration to ensure that open source software components and the software supply chains they flow through demonstrate the highest cybersecurity integrity.</p>

  <p>Many leading companies and organizations don‚Äôt recognize how many parts of their critical infrastructure depend on open source. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs essential that we see more public and private investment in keeping that ecosystem healthy and secure. ‚Ä¶ Given the importance of digital infrastructure in our lives, it‚Äôs time to start thinking of it in the same way we do our physical infrastructure. Open source software is a connective tissue for much of the online world ‚Äî it deserves the same focus and funding we give to our roads and bridges.</p>
