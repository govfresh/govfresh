I"π<p>In-Q-Tel built a ‚Äúnutrition label‚Äù prototype that gives developers insight into the health of open source software packages.</p>

<p>In-Q-Tel <a href="https://www.iqt.org/open-source-software-nutrition-labels-an-ai-assurance-application/">asks</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If software developers and software program managers had access to information about the health and security of specific open source software packages ‚Äì like shoppers in a grocery store looking at food nutrition labels ‚Äì would they be empowered to make better choices about which software packages to use?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For context, In-Q-Tel created a <a href="https://trui4.csb.app/">nutrition label for FakeFinder</a>, an open source tool that analyzes whether videos contain deepfakes.</p>

<p>Indicators used for the label include package totals for contributors, maintainers, dependencies and versions, as well as license type funding resources, package health scores and days since last release.</p>

<p>The tool was built using React, TypeScript and LineUp.</p>

<p>Code for the OSS nutrition label is available at the <a href="https://github.com/IQTLabs/OSSNutritionLabelPrototypes">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
