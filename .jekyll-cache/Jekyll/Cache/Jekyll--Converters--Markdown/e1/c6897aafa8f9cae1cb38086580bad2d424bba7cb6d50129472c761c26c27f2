I"G<p>Say hello to <a href="https://civicfolio.govfresh.com">CivicFolio</a>, a portfolio website theme for civic technologists.</p>

<p>The genesis of this project came from a series of conversations <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cnwagwu/">Chizobam Nwagwu</a> and I had about how folks at the beginning of their careers can build an online presence for themselves in the context of learning and adopting basic civic technology tools, projects and principles.</p>

<p>Over the course of the past few months, I built out a prototype that would start to address this. While it’s not perfect – I’ll be the first to admit that my coding skills are limited – it’s hopefully a foundation for helping folks understand .</p>

<p>CivicFolio uses Public Sans and the U.S. Web Design System for the front-end and Jekyll and GitHub Pages for content management and hosting.</p>
