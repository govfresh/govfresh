I"Z<p>Olay’s <a href="https://www.olay.com/opentochange">Open to Change</a> advertising campaign is something government should take note of and emulate.</p>

<p>Open to Change focuses on Olay making its jar design more accessible. A new lid makes it easy to open, but also has “face cream” in Braille on the top.</p>

<p>I first saw this as an advertisement in the print edition of The New York Times, but there is also an accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2cpLH1xLcE">video</a> and <a href="https://www.olay.com/opentochange">website</a>.</p>

<p>The first page of the four-page spread has negative testimonials from Olay users, such as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I literally cannot open the stupid jar on my own.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have tried allll night to get this jar open. Please please make this easier.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please reconsider the design of your jar.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether these quotes are fabricated or not makes no real difference. The fact that Olay is creating a corporate culture of openness and engagement with its consumers, it also is addressing the real needs of people who’s bodies are a mismatch with poor product design.</p>

<p>The message is that Olay is willing to subject itself to negative feedback, but use it to publicly address and resolve issues.</p>

<p>Your customers or community are openly talking about your product and services – whether its skin care or public services – and its an opportunity to respond and exceed expectations but addressing these issues. By doing so in a public way, creating feedback loops that show empathy, you can build trust and appreciation in public institutions.</p>

<p>While its only a limited edition, hopefully this is just the beginning of standard product design for Olay but also inspiration for others.</p>
