<blockquote>
  <p>As we look ahead to 2022, weâ€™re in touch with another six states who plan on following Washingtonâ€™s lead, bringing code originally developed in California to even more Americans in the next few months. We put together a playbook that documented some of what we learned this year as we built and shipped the DCVR Portal, and expect other states may find it instructive as they explore doing something similar to what we did in California.</p>
