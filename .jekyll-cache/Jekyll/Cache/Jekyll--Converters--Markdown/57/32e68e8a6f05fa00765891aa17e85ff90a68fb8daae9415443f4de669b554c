I"¬<p>The American Customer Satisfaction Index published its annual citizen satisfaction survey results, and</p>

<p>From the announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the fourth consecutive annual decline in citizen satisfaction and marks an unprecedented run of negative movement in the index. Significantly, the federal government score is now at its lowest-ever recorded level. The results for this study are based on interviews with citizens who experienced a federal government service throughout 2021. All of these interviews were conducted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and amid the fallout from the contentious 2020 federal electionsâ€”two events that strongly impacted many citizensâ€™ perceptions of the federal government.</p>
