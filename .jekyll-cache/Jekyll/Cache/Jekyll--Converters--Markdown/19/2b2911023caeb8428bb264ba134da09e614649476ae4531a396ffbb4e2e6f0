I"X<p>I’m a huge proponent that all government websites should end with the .gov extension. There are thousands of local government websites that should be leveraging the U.S. government’s <a href="https://dotgov.gov">DotGov</a> domain name services that currently don’t.</p>

<p>The implications are that it’s difficult for the public to validate whether a website is official or not. At <a href="https://proudcity.com">ProudCity</a>, we’ve heard numerous stories of rogue websites created by members of the community that appear to be official.</p>

<p>Much like the HTTPS protocol which verifies that a website is encrypted, we must build a standard that validates a website is an official government website. While there is a role for browsers to play, the .gov extension is one aspect of this.</p>

<p>I’ve always felt the DotGov program could be less bureacratic in its presentation and make a more welcoming and compelling case for its adoption.</p>

<p>As we did with the <a href="/thoughts/coding-covid-dashboard">COVID dashboard</a>, my son and I built a front door that attempts to do just this. He created a look-up tool that pulls from the <a href="https://home.dotgov.gov/data/">data provided by DotGov</a>.</p>

<p>If you are responsible for an official government website, <a href="https://dotgov.govfresh.com">it’s time to go .gov</a>.</p>
