<p>Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) Round Two Now Open</p>

<p>From the California Department of Technlogy blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Innovation and speed are terms that are too rarely applied in government. As part of the Governorâ€™s 2021-22 Budget, CDT received $25 million in limited resources to demonstrate how investments in agile IT solutions can rapidly improve government services. The TMF works to proactively invest in projects that modernize digital services for residents and state employees. Since its launch, the TMF has delivered quick results â€“ four projects received immediate funding to kickstart improvements that directly benefit Californians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, round two of the innovative grant process opens â€“ state entities may now submit proposals through April 8. Projects must have clear, concrete goals, a viable and quick path to delivery, and strong support from the requesting entityâ€™s executive leadership.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated based on their probability of success, replicability, and support of statewide goals.</p>
