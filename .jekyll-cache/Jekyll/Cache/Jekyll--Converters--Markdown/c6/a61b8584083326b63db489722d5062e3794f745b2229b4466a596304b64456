I"2<p>As part of Governor Gavin Newsom’s 2021-22 budget, the California Department of Technology has received $25 million “to demonstrate how investments in agile IT solutions can rapidly improve government services.”</p>

<p>The resourcing is round two of the state’s <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/tmf/">technology modernization fund</a> and is available only to state entities.</p>

<p>From the TMF website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The TMF was established to make immediate investments in IT that will yield quick and meaningful results for the people of California. CDT invites California state departments or entities to submit business challenges that require an IT solution to modernize government and improve digital services for California residents and state employees. This will enable departments to deliver timely business modernization wins through a high-value proof of concept, fulfill an immediate need, and optimize services for digital government. A strong commitment from the department’s business and IT leadership and team capability are required to be successful.</p>

<p>“Innovation and speed are terms that are too rarely applied in government,” <a href="https://techblog.cdt.ca.gov/2022/03/technology-modernization-fund-tmf-round-two-now-open/">said</a> the CDT when announcing the new funding.</p>

<p>If you talk to the leaders of California’s COVID rapid response team, you’ll find the work and lessons learned from the Alpha project (many on that team immediately transitioned there) played a highly impactful and under-reference role in the state’s success in launching its COVID website.</p>

<p>Those lessons are also showing up elsewhere, Cannabis to the new California Web Design System.</p>

<p>During the Alpha project’s send-off event, the state’s technology leaders heard presentations by Alpha team members on how it was executed and the lessons learned.</p>

<p>At the end of the presentations, there was a question and answer session. An agency chief information officer raised his hand and asked, “How do we scale this across all California agencies?”</p>

<p>He asked the $25 million question.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the state already has its answer.</p>

  <p>Projects must have clear, concrete goals, a viable and quick path to delivery, and strong support from the requesting entity’s executive leadership.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated based on their probability of success, replicability, and support of statewide goals.</p>
