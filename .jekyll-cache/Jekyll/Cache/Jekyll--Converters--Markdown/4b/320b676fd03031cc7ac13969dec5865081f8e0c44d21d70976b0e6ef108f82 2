As executive director of the <a href="https://www.participatorybudgeting.org">Participatory Budgeting Project</a>, they champion a framework that empowers all people to truly have a say in how their communities are funded.</p>

<p>Said Shari on <a href="https://thegovweneed.com/episode/how-government-can-make-public-budgeting-more-participatory">The Government We Need</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe government we need is one that I can say ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô, and it means participatory democracy, that that is understood, normalized. I think the conditions that we kind of require to support good PB is an opportunity  for folks to live into transparency. Is an opportunity for folks to reflect and reckon with what has happened in our country. The challenging parts and the beautiful parts. And then for us to think about what we need now. We need government that is ready, willing and able to have conversations, resource those conversations and to spend the time doing that. Deep engagement and real democracy doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. It takes time, effort, engagement, process, infrastructure. Those are the things that are going to create this reality of deep democracy, true engagement and a really reflective government that grows with us, that is living and breathing as we live and breathe.‚Äù</p>
