I"<	<p>I’m a huge proponent that all government websites should end with the .gov extension. If they don’t, the public will continue to be confused as to whether a website is legitimately managed by a government entity.</p>

<p>There are thousands of local government websites that should be leveraging the U.S. government’s <a href="https://dotgov.gov">DotGov</a> domain name services that currently don’t. At <a href="https://proudcity.com">ProudCity</a>, we’ve heard numerous stories of rogue websites created by community members that appear to be official, but are not.</p>

<p>Much like the HTTPS protocol, which verifies that a website is encrypted, we must build a standard that validates a website is officially government operated. While there is a role that browsers play, as they do with encryption, universal adoption of the .gov extension is fundamental to this.</p>

<p>The good news is that we’re hearing there’s an increased demand for DotGov services. But, given the volume of government websites that need to adopt .gov domains, we still need increased advocacy and an overall more inviting user experience.</p>

<p>I’ve always felt the DotGov program could be less bureacratic in its presentation and make a more welcoming and compelling case for its adoption. As we did with the <a href="/thoughts/coding-covid-dashboard">COVID dashboard</a>, my son and I built an <a href="https://dotgov.govfresh.com">alternative DotGov digital front door</a> (<a href="https://github.com/govfresh/dotgov">repository</a>) that attempts to do just this.  To prototype a different approach, he created a .gov domain look-up tool that pulls from the <a href="https://home.dotgov.gov/data/">data provided by DotGov</a>, and I wrote copy and designed a simple page to accompany this.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this is an inspiration to those who manage the DotGov service that we can be less bureacratic in the .gov registry user experience. Many local governments are less technical and have little resources to apply for a process that appears to be cumbersome. The experience should be welcoming, compelling, simple and seamless.</p>

<p>Let’s set a goal that all U.S. government websites have a .gov extension by the end of 2023.</p>

<p>If you are responsible for an official government website, <a href="https://dotgov.govfresh.com">go .gov</a>.</p>
