<h3 id="you-just-started-a-new-gig-hows-it-going">You just started a new gig. Howâ€™s it going?</h3>

<p>Yes, I just joined <a href="https://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> as communications director. Iâ€™m still basking in the energy of our recent Summit, which was a much-needed reunion for a lot of people in the civic tech community.</p>

<p>And Iâ€™m excited about whatâ€™s ahead for Code for America. Weâ€™re doing everything from helping local government create education and job opportunities for young Black adults, to helping the federal government simplify tax filing.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-value-of-communications-within-civic-tech">Whatâ€™s the value of communications within civic tech?</h3>

<p>Civic tech is nebulous. Depending on who you ask, it could be anything from enterprise software to service design to bespoke apps. Communications can clearly articulate what youâ€™re doing in civic tech and, more importantly, why.</p>

<p>No matter the context, all civic technologists ultimately want to have a positive impact on the public. Our work isnâ€™t just about modernizing systems. Itâ€™s about getting critical services and resources to people who need them. Itâ€™s about creating ways to involve and empower people who have been left out.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s the story that communications can tell.</p>

<p>And thatâ€™s what ultimately gets people fired-up about the mission of civic tech.</p>

<h3 id="whats-top-of-mind-for-you-right-now">Whatâ€™s top of mind for you right now?</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m fortunate to be on a team thatâ€™s incredibly diverse â€” probably the most diverse of my career, in fact. Iâ€™m deeply grateful for this.</p>

<p>But itâ€™s also made me wonder how to drive more representation across civic tech and government at-large. The public needs to see themselves in public service.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s critical for building trust.</p>

<p>Beyond that, solving hard problems demands diversity. Lived experiences are a tremendous asset. We need that depth of empathy and perspective if weâ€™re really going to serve all the people.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-you-see-are-the-fundamental-reasons-civic-tech-is-lacking-representation">What do you see are the fundamental reasons civic tech is lacking representation?</h3>

<p>I think civic techâ€™s lack of diversity is due to low visibility and inadequate access. Civic tech careers arenâ€™t marketed to marginalized communities. And they certainly donâ€™t feel easy to attain.</p>

<p>Beyond that, it can be hard for BIPOC talent to navigate a career in civic tech.</p>

<p>Before joining Code for America, I sat through many meetings where I was the only person of color. Iâ€™ve also been the only person of color on many teams. Thatâ€™s isolating, of course.</p>

<p>My experience isnâ€™t unique in civic tech.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-we-change-that">How can we change that?</h3>

<p>If weâ€™re going to attract more diversity into civic tech, I believe we have to meet those candidates where they are. I think that starts with outreach at junior and high school levels, when kids are still wrapping their heads around whatâ€™s possible for them.</p>

<p>I should also note that thereâ€™s a ton of progress being made for early-career civic technologists. Groups like Coding It Forward and U.S. Digital Corp are doing great work to build the talent pipeline â€” and although itâ€™s not explicitly tailored to BIPOC talent, there is a strong DEI component.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-the-civic-tech-community-be-more-proactive-on-inclusivity">How can the civic tech community be more proactive on inclusivity?</h3>

<p>For starters, Iâ€™d encourage everyone in civic tech to take an honest look at who they are elevating as thought leaders in our industry.</p>

<p>Seemingly simple actions â€” like who we amplify on social media, or who we invite to speak on a panel â€” matter and they set a tone for our industry.</p>

<p>We should all ask ourselves if and howâ€™re making space for BIPOC talent in civic tech.</p>

<h3 id="whats-your-civic-tech-pitch-to-government-leaders">Whatâ€™s your civic tech pitch to government leaders?</h3>

<p>Government must be able to deliver the basics in our modern world. Beyond working websites, there should be easy â€” even intuitive â€” ways to connect people to their government. And those experiences should be rooted in empathy.</p>

<p>That starts with understanding peopleâ€™s needs. The systems and technology flow from that.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t a moonshot. Weâ€™re already seeing this pivot from the status quo. Granted, itâ€™s not at scale. Not yet. But I believe weâ€™ll get there.</p>

<h3 id="what-advice-do-you-have-for-those-exploring-careers-in-civic-tech">What advice do you have for those exploring careers in civic tech?</h3>

<p>Thereâ€™s nobility in civic tech. Itâ€™s incredibly meaningful to help improve public systems. But it can also be draining. You often feel like youâ€™re not making a dent, like change isnâ€™t happening fast enough.</p>

<p>So, my advice would be to keep heart. Remember, we wonâ€™t change institutions overnight. But that doesnâ€™t make the mission unworthy. Find the thing that fired you up to do this work, and hold on to that.</p>

<p>Also, find the people who embody that spark. Theyâ€™ll surely be a balm when motivation runs low.</p>
