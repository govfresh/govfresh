<p>2022 was transformative for me.</p>

<p>This year, Iâ€™ve re-imagined what <a href="https://govfresh.com">GovFresh</a> could be and worked towards building that out (more on this in January).</p>

<p>I also changed the context of my work with <a href="https://proudcity.com">ProudCity</a> and eliminated (nearly) all of the noise surrounding the government technology market and just stayed focused on building a great business that helps local governments deliver great digital services.</p>

<p>Even before the change in Twitter ownership and, with the exception of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukefretwell">LinkedIn</a>, Iâ€™ve been intentional about avoiding distractions â€“ especially social media trappings â€“ and have just focused on doing the work.</p>

<p>The results of this will show up more in 2023, and Iâ€™m excited about whatâ€™s to come. Iâ€™m looking forward to learning and meeting new people doing amazing work thatâ€™s changing the way we think about democracy.</p>

<h3 id="pedigree-and-public-interest-technology">Pedigree and public interest technology</h3>

<p>Based on many conversations, I wrote about <a href="https://govfresh.com/thoughts/pedigree-public-interest-technology">pedigree and public interest technology</a>, something I think will increasingly be a topic of discussion in 2023.</p>

<p>So much of the leadership and noise in public interest technology is based on academic background rather than true meritocracy.</p>

<p>Folks are hesitant to openly discuss this for fear of professional retribution, and it would help if more people with pedigree backgrounds openly acknowledged and worked towards changing the dynamic. I think folks who are tired of being slighted will begin to press for this conversation to happen.</p>

<h3 id="rss-government">RSS government</h3>

<p>With social mediaâ€™s reckoning, government must rethink its long-term communications strategy. My piece on <a href="https://govfresh.com/thoughts/rss-government">RSS and government</a> captures why itâ€™s important for public sector institutions to default to an open standard and more of an interoperable approach to information sharing.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s important to leverage social media, including <a href="https://govfresh.com/thoughts/government-civictech-medium">Medium</a>, but we must also begin to think critically about and execute on a foundational strategy that is platform-agnostic and sustainable.</p>

<h3 id="proudly-serving">Proudly Serving</h3>

<p>One of the civic projects Iâ€™m most proud of is <a href="https://proudlyservingbook.com">Proudly Serving</a>, a playbook to help local governments build people-centered digital public services.</p>

<p>What I love about this project is both working with my co-maintainers (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccawoodbury/">Rebecca Woodbury</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marlena-medford/">Marlena Medford</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kwyatt/">Kirsten Wyatt</a>) and building it openly and collaboratively.</p>

<p>We have an amazing list of <a href="https://proudlyservingbook.com/people/">contributors</a>, and I invite anyone to think about <a href="https://proudlyservingbook.com/contribute/">contributing</a>. The central <a href="https://github.com/proudlyserving/proudlyserving.github.io">GitHub repository</a> and <a href="https://github.com/proudlyserving/proudlyserving.github.io/projects/1">project board</a> gives insight into how weâ€™re working.</p>

<p>My hope is that similar projects will grow from this when itâ€™s complete, because I think itâ€™s a framework for communities to build a resource openly and collaboratively, and a great way to exercise key muscles of democracy.</p>

<h3 id="civic-hacking">Civic hacking</h3>

<p>One of the greatest joys of 2022 has been <a href="https://govfresh.com/topics/civic-hacking">civic hacking</a> with my son, Elias.</p>

<p>All of this is on display (in very much alpha) at <a href="https://usa.govfresh.com">USA.GovFresh</a>. Iâ€™ve written some about it and will update more by yearâ€™s end, but itâ€™s been amazing to build with him, watch him learn and, most importantly, learn from him.</p>

<h2 id="direct-message">Direct message</h2>

<p>I started a new Q&amp;A feature (<a href="/dm">Direct message</a>) and got the chance to open up conversations to the general public with folks I think are doing amazing work, including <a href="https://govfresh.com/dm/rebecca-woodbury">Rebecca Woodbury</a>, <a href="https://govfresh.com/dm/victor-sauceda">Victor Sauceda</a>, <a href="https://govfresh.com/dm/andrew-hening">Andrew Hening</a>, <a href="https://govfresh.com/dm/marlena-medford">Marlena Medford</a>, <a href="https://govfresh.com/dm/carla-briceno">Carla Briceno</a> and <a href="https://govfresh.com/dm/angie-quirarte">Angie Quirarte</a>.</p>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<p>Notable books I read in 2022 were Ro Kahnnaâ€™s <a href="https://govfresh.com/reviews/review-citizens">Dignity in a Digital Age</a> and <a href="https://govfresh.com/reviews/review-citizens">Citizens</a> by Jon Alexander and Ariane Conrad. There are many others, especially as I listen to more audiobooks, but those two stand out.</p>

<p>Up next is Lori Carverâ€™s <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/83650/9781635767704">Escaping Gravity</a>, which I will start reading at the beginning of the new year.</p>

<h2 id="podcast">Podcast</h2>

<p><a href="https://podcast.govfresh.com">The GovFresh Podcast</a> will launch in 2023. This is a continuation and re-branding of The Government We Need, but itâ€™ll be just me hosting.</p>

<h2 id="community">Community</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve started a <a href="https://govfresh.com/community">GovFresh community</a> with a small group of amazing people. Honestly, itâ€™s one of the most fulfilling moments of my days, and Iâ€™m grateful for the folks whoâ€™ve joined. Iâ€™m particularly grateful for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marylazzeri/">Mary</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shirahonig/">Shira</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marlena-medford/">Marlena</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kwyatt/">Kirsten</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/artuoma/">Art</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kwyatt/">Rebecca</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lenaeboykinstorey/">Lenae</a> for being especially engaged.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s currently invite only, and if you would like to join, send an email to  <a href="mailto:community@govfresh.com">community@govfresh.com</a> with â€˜GovFresh communityâ€™ in the subject.</p>

<h2 id="reminder">Reminder</h2>

<p>The work weâ€™re doing is important. Sometimes itâ€™s extremely hard and thankless. Remember to take time for yourself, whether itâ€™s an hour walk, a reset day, the week, month, whatever. But also make sure to show gratitude to others for the work theyâ€™re doing. We donâ€™t have to be constantly in motion or distressed.</p>

<p>If weâ€™re not grounded and present, then it will show up inherently â€“ and quietly â€“ in the work.</p>

<p>The context for civic technology should be joy â€“ for those doing the work and those receiving the services we build.</p>
