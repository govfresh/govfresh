I"£<p>The state of California launched a beta version of its new design system, that aims to make it ‚Äúeasy for state digital teams to build accessible, consistent, and performant services and products to meet Californians‚Äô needs.‚Äù</p>

<p>About the project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can be challenging to connect government services to Californians who need them most. We have to consider a wide range of experiences, abilities, education, and technical literacy. With the State of California‚Äôs Design System, we help make digital information and services easier to use. The Design System increases equity, unity, compassion, and trust.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of the design system was first initiated by the state‚Äôs <a href="https://alpha.ca.gov/">Alpha project</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alpha was the first effort to reimagine how government understands, builds and provides digital services. The primary goal was to create a better digital experience for all Californians. The CA.gov Alpha team adopted agile principles allowing them to quickly iterate on feedback while blogging their story out in the open.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/">California Design System</a> includes <a href="https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/principles/">design principles</a>, <a href="https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/style/content/">content and design guides</a> and a <a href="https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/components/">component library</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/">Department of Cannabis Control</a> and <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/">COVID-19</a> websites are now using the design system.</p>
