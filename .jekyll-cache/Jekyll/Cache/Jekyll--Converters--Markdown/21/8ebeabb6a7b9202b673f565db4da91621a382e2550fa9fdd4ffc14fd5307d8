I"†<p>To help the federal government address challenges ‚Äúin hiring, managing, and retaining staff with digital skills,‚Äù the U.S. Government Accountability Office recommends the creation of a digital service academy.</p>

<p>From the report, <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105388">Digital Services: Considerations for a Federal Academy to Develop a Pipeline of Digital Staff</a>:</p>

<p>‚ÄúGAO convened a roundtable discussion on October 13, 2021 comprised of chief technology officers, chief data officers, chief information officers, and those in similar roles across the federal government, as well as knowledgeable representatives from academia and nonprofits. This report summarizes the perspectives that selected technology leaders shared on (1) federal workforce needs for digital services staff, (2) key characteristics of a digital service academy, and (3) considerations to help ensure federal agencies can absorb graduates of a digital service academy.‚Äù</p>

<p>From the report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One potential method for developing digital services staff, discussed by the roundtable participants, is the creation of a digital service academy‚Äîsimilar to military academies‚Äîto train future civil servants in the digital skills needed to modernize government. Considerations for a digital service academy include the kinds of skills that would be taught and the composition and size of a graduating class, according to roundtable participants. Further, they said digital services staff would need proficiency in both digital skills as well understanding the functions of government to meet agencies‚Äô needs. The composition and size of a digital service academy could affect how it can meet agencies‚Äô needs.</p>
