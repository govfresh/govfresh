I"∂<p>At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Chief Data Officers Council <a href="/radar/cdo-council-2021-playbook">published a playbook</a> to help CDOs ‚Äúlead data-driven transformation‚Äù within their agencies.</p>

<p>What struck me as odd ‚Äì especially coming from an organization that should always default to a data-driven approach to everything it does ‚Äì was that the playbook itself came in only one format: A PDF.</p>

<p>Disappointed by this, I built a <a href="https://cdoplaybook.govfresh.com">web-based version</a> (<a href="https://github.com/govfresh/cdo-playbook">repository</a>) to make it more accessible.</p>

<p>In the future, I hope to see the CDO Council publish information in both text or web-based formats.</p>

<p>Other suggestions for the CDO Council:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a fifth play focused on privacy/security.</li>
  <li>Add RSS functionality to the website (as a data-driven approach to sharing updates)</li>
</ul>
