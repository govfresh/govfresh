I" <p>GOV.UK Head of Product Leanne Cummings shares the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/roadmap">GOV.UK roadmap for the 2020 to 2021 financial year</a>.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2021/02/01/weve-got-a-new-public-gov-uk-roadmap">post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our roadmap publication is part of our commitment to working in the open, enshrined in our tenth government design principle: “Make things open: it makes things better”. It means anyone – whether they work on GOV.UK, frequently use GOV.UK or are merely curious – can see how we’re improving GOV.UK for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What’s great about about the public roadmap, particularly for large government institutions, is that they show there is a plan, but they are also a powerful demonstration of civic openness. More digital teams should expose and actively socialize this both as an exercise in transparency, but also as an entree to deeper civic engagement.
Suggestions</p>

<p>Suggestions for digital government roadmaps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Publish these annually, update them quarterly</li>
  <li>Standardize their location (ex: /roadmap like https://www.gov.uk/roadmap)</li>
  <li>Provide an opportunity for deeper engagement (link to a public GitHub repo, email address or feedback form)</li>
</ul>
