I"œ<p>Say hello to <a href="https://civicfolio.govfresh.com">CivicFolio</a>, a portfolio website theme for civic technologists.</p>

<p>The genesis of this project came from a series of conversations <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cnwagwu/">Chizobam Nwagwu</a> and I had about how folks at the beginning of their careers can create an online presence for themselves in the context of civic technology.</p>

<p>CivicFolio aims to help civic-interested designers and technologists build their portfolio websites while learning (by doing) the basic principles of civic technology:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working in public</li>
  <li>Building inclusive, accessible websites</li>
  <li>Using open, collaborative tools and technologies</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the course of the past few months â€“ with feedback from Chizo â€“ I built out a prototype that would start to address this. While itâ€™s not perfect â€“ and never will be â€“ itâ€™s hopefully a foundation that helps folks get started.</p>

<p>CivicFolio uses the <a href="https://public-sans.digital.gov/">U.S. Web Design System</a> and <a href="https://public-sans.digital.gov/">Public Sans</a> for the front-end and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for content management and hosting.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/govfresh/civicfolio/wiki">documentation</a> to help you get started. If needed, weâ€™ll provide <a href="https://github.com/govfresh/civicfolio/wiki/Support">support</a> as be as we can.</p>
