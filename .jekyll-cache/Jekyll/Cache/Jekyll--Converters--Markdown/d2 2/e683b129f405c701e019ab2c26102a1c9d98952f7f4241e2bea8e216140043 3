I"º<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency has published <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/11/16/new-federal-government-cybersecurity-incident-and-vulnerability">Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks</a> to ‚Äúprovide federal civilian executive branch agencies with operational procedures for planning and conducting cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAlthough CISA created the playbooks for FCEB agencies, we encourage critical infrastructure entities; state, local, territorial, and tribal government organizations; and private sector organizations to review them to benchmark their own vulnerability and incident response practices,‚Äù says CISA.</p>

<p>The playbooks are in response to the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order (EO) 14028: Improving the Nation‚Äôs Cybersecurity</a> focused on removing barriers to sharing threat information.</p>
