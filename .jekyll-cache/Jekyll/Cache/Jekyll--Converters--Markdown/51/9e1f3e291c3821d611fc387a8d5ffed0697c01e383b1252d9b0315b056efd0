I":<p>At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Chief Data Officers Council <a href="/radar/cdo-council-2021-playbook">published a playbook</a> to help CDOs “lead data-driven transformation” within their agencies.</p>

<p>What struck me as odd – especially coming from an organization that should default to a data-driven approach to everything – was that the playbook itself came in only one format: A PDF.</p>

<p>Disappointed by the lack of accessibility, I built a <a href="https://cdoplaybook.govfresh.com">web-based version</a> (<a href="">repository</a>).</p>
