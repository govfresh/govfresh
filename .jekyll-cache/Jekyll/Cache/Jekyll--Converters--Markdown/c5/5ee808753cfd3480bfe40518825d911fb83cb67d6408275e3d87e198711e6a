I"<p>For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>, it’s a platform that allows for anyone – individuals or organizations – to freely publish articles for public consumption (up to three articles – unless you pay the subscription).</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the federal face of government digital service – U.S. Digital Service – hosts <a href="https://usdigitalservice.medium.com/">its blog on Medium</a>. For an agency whose mission it is “to deliver better government services to the American people through technology and design” and an administration that aims to more inclusive, it’s time for USDS to migrate back to the main usds.gov domain. If it doesn’t, we’ll know who they really intend their message for – and who they don’t.</p>
