I"Ω<p>The state of California launched a beta version of its new design system, that aims to make it ‚Äúeasy for state digital teams to build accessible, consistent, and performant services and products to meet Californians‚Äô needs.‚Äù</p>

<p>About the project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can be challenging to connect government services to Californians who need them most. We have to consider a wide range of experiences, abilities, education, and technical literacy. With the State of California‚Äôs Design System, we help make digital information and services easier to use. The Design System increases equity, unity, compassion, and trust.</p>
