I",<p>For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>, it’s a platform that allows for anyone – individuals or organizations – to freely publish articles for public consumption.</p>

<p>There are two fundamental problems with government agencies using Medium as a publishing platform:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Content is paywalled after a certain number of article views.</li>
  <li>Medium’s accessibility conformance is dismal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Public access to government information should never be limited by the need for a credit card. Medium should work with public sector organizations to exempt them from the paywall.</p>

<p>The larger issue related to government agencies publishing information to Medium is that it’s commitment to digital access is terrible. <a href=""></a></p>

<p>Surprisingly, the federal face of government digital service – U.S. Digital Service – hosts <a href="https://usdigitalservice.medium.com/">its blog on Medium</a>. For an agency whose mission it is “to deliver better government services to the American people through technology and design” and an administration that aims to more inclusive, it’s time for USDS to migrate back to the main usds.gov domain. If it doesn’t, we’ll know who they really intend their message for – and who they don’t.</p>
