I"<p>The civic technology community has sadly lost one of its own: <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/kevin-walsh-memorial-fund">Kevin Joseph Walsh</a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, July 12, Kev was <a href="https://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/news/local-news/friends-and-family-mourn-death-of-man-killed-while-walking-in-eugenia">struck and killed by a car</a> while walking with his partner and friends.</p>

<p>Kev carried himself with calm, humility and good nature. A complete listener, he was fully present in every conversation.</p>

<p>In his craft — civic design — Kev was thoughtful, articulate and impactful. He was a mentor and inspiration, always leading from behind. His work in civic and government service design contributed deeply to the world we all want for our future.</p>

<p>Kev, I will always cherish your witty chat banter that left me crying with laughter — precious moments of joy you gave me that I will carry forever. I’m grateful to have shared a little bit of time with you. I’m honored to have witnessed your authenticity and unconditional support for others.</p>

<p>The  impression you left — on me and so many others — will forever be remembered with love and gratitude.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/kevin-walsh-memorial-fund">memorial fund</a> has been established to support Kev’s family — his partner and two daughters. If you are a member of the civic technology community, whether you knew Kev or not, I encourage you to <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/kevin-walsh-memorial-fund">donate</a>.</p>
