I"ä<p>As part of the Governor Gavin Newsom‚Äôs 2021-22 budget, the California Department of Technology has received $25 million ‚Äúto demonstrate how investments in agile IT solutions can rapidly improve government services.‚Äù</p>

<p>The resourcing is part of round two of the <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/tmf/">CDT technology modernization fund</a> and is available only to state entities.</p>

<p>From the TMF website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The TMF was established to make immediate investments in IT that will yield quick and meaningful results for the people of California. CDT invites California state departments or entities to submit business challenges that require an IT solution to modernize government and improve digital services for California residents and state employees. This will enable departments to deliver timely business modernization wins through a high-value proof of concept, fulfill an immediate need, and optimize services for digital government. A strong commitment from the department‚Äôs business and IT leadership and team capability are required to be successful.</p>

<p>‚ÄúInnovation and speed are terms that are too rarely applied in government,‚Äù <a href="https://techblog.cdt.ca.gov/2022/03/technology-modernization-fund-tmf-round-two-now-open/">said</a> the CDT when announcing the new funding.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Projects must have clear, concrete goals, a viable and quick path to delivery, and strong support from the requesting entity‚Äôs executive leadership.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated based on their probability of success, replicability, and support of statewide goals.</p>
