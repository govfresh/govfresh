<p>From the <a href="https://www.theacsi.org/news-and-resources/customer-satisfaction-reports/reports-2021/acsi-federal-government-report-2021">announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ACSI federal government model measures four primary drivers of citizen satisfaction that are quality attributes which represent the most relevant performance areas of government agencies and services. Among these drivers of satisfaction, all four decline between 2020 and 2021: efficiency and ease of government processes (-5% to 63), ease of accessing and clarity of information (-3% to 67), the courtesy and professionalism of customer service (-1% to 73), and perceptions of government website quality (-1% to 70). Collectively, these declines represent a broad erosion of the quality of federal government services experienced by citizens in 2021.</p>
