I"ù	<p>The Defense Innovation Unit published <a href="https://www.diu.mil/responsible-ai-guidelines">Responsible AI Guidelines</a> to help the Defense Department operationalize ethical principles for artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDIU‚Äôs RAI Guidelines provide a step-by-step framework for AI companies, DoD stakeholders, and program managers that can help to ensure that AI programs align with the DoD‚Äôs Ethical Principles for AI and that fairness, accountability and transparency are considered at each step in the development cycle of an AI system,‚Äù <a href="https://www.diu.mil/latest/diu-operationalizes-responsible-ai-guidelines-in-practice">said</a> Dr. Jared Dunnmon, technical director of the AI/ML portfolio at DIU.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Responsible.</strong> DoD personnel will exercise appropriate levels of judgment and care, while remaining responsible for the development, deployment, and use of AI capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Equitable.</strong> The Department will take deliberate steps to minimize unintended bias in AI capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Traceable.</strong> The Department‚Äôs AI capabilities will be developed and deployed such that relevant personnel possess an appropriate understanding of the technology, development processes, and operational methods applicable to AI capabilities, including with transparent and auditable methodologies, data  sources, and design procedure and documentation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Reliable.</strong> The Department‚Äôs AI capabilities will have explicit, well-defined uses, and the safety, security, and effectiveness of such capabilities will be subject to testing and assurance within those defined uses across their entire life-cycles.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Governable.</strong> The Department will design and engineer AI capabilities to  fulfill their intended functions while possessing the ability to detect and avoid unintended consequences, and the ability to disengage or deactivate deployed systems that demonstrate unintended behavior.</p>
