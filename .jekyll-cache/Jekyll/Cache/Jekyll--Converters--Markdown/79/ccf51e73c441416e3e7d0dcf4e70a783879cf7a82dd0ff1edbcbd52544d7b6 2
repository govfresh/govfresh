<p>96.4% of the requests came from law enforcement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of the 335 requests we received in 2021, we disclosed information in response to 269 of those. We disclosed information in response to 178 subpoenas (170 criminal and 8 civil), 64 court orders, 22 search warrants, and five requests made under exigent circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of note:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of the 269 times we disclosed information in 2021, we were only able to notify users nine times. Gag orders prevented us from notifying users in 255 of the other requests. The other five were processed under exigent circumstances, where we delay notification if we determine it is necessary to prevent death or serious harm or due to an ongoing investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the number of requests with gag orders continues to be a rising trend as a percentage of overall requests, it correlates with the number of criminal requests we processed. Legal requests in criminal matters often come with a gag order, since law enforcement authorities often assert that notification would interfere with the investigation. On the other hand, civil matters are typically public record, and the target of the legal process is often a party to the litigation, obviating the need for any secrecy. None of the civil requests we processed this year came with a gag order, which means we notified each of the affected users.</p>
