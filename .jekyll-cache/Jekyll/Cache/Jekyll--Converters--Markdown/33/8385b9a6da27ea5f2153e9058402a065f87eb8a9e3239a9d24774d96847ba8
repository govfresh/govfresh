<p>From TOPS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Much of the Summit will showcase the work of hundreds of participants in this yearâ€™s The Opportunity Project (TOP) sprints. TOP is a leading federal innovation model that brings cross-sector partners together to solve problems for people nationwide, using federal open data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This year, 7 federal agencies (the U.S. Census Bureau, HHS, NOAA, MBDA, Treasury, CFPB, and HUD) and 2 cities (New York and Coral Gables, FL) led TOP sprints focused on the World Post-COVID-19. Weâ€™ll feature the resulting new products and announce more than $300,000 in awards to the winners of the Open Data for Good Grand Challenge.</p>
