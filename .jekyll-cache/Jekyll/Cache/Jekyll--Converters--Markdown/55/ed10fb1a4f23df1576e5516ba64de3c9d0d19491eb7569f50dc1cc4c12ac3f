I"¦<p>Formerly the Office of Digital Innovation, the state of California has renamed this to the Office of Data &amp; Innovation, which includes a merger of Office of Digital Innovation (now CalInnovate)
The CalData team, led by the stateâ€™s Chief Data Officer
The Center for Government Excellence and Transformation (GET)</p>

<p>From the announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GOV.UK PaaS was set up in 2015, to help public sector organisations quickly and securely host their digital services without worrying about infrastructure. However, 7 years is a long time in tech and things have changed. The big cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP and others) have upped their game and reduced the barriers to entry for digital teams. Over the same period departments have built better and more expert in-house cloud engineering capability, and are (broadly) clustering around a Kubernetes based architecture.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>GOV.UK PaaS has not seen the rapid and continued growth that weâ€™ve seen with some of our other platform products, and is now at a point where we either invest heavily in some significant technical architecture changes, or we make the difficult decision to sunset the product. We have decided to do the latter, and GOV.UK PaaS will be decommissioned over the next 18 months.</p>
