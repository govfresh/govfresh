I"h<p>On this year’s <a href="https://opendataday.org">Open Data Day</a>, my son and I set up <a href="https://usa.govfresh.com">USA.GovFresh</a>.</p>

<p>We started with a <a href="https://usa.govfresh.com/government">government</a> section that displays all of the U.S. federal agencies. The main government page displays all top-level agencies and other independent organizations maintained by the federal government. Each agency page contains the organization logo, description, website link, parent agency link (if any), a list of the subagencies (if any) and the latest published Federal Register documents.</p>

<p>The data is pulled from the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/">Federal Register agency API</a>.</p>

<p>Going forward, we’ll use <a href="https://usa.govfresh.com">USA.GovFresh</a> as a place to build together and learn about government in the context of coding and public data.</p>

<p>If you have ideas for us, please add them to the <a href="https://github.com/govfresh/usa/issues">GitHub issues queue</a>.</p>
