<p>Advancing the Federal Data Strategy</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>The federal Chief Data Officer (CDO) position is a pivotal and transformational role that can significantly benefit the collection, organization, analysis and use of data in the agency as well as improve its value to society. The CDO must embrace the roles of change agent and evangelist to bring the inspirational vision of what data can do for all stakeholders.</p>

<p>CDOs must seize opportunities to leverage data as a strategic asset within their organization, otherwise, the CDO faces the risk of becoming a compliance driven position. The CDO should first focus on finding opportunities to promote the sharing and access of data within their agencies. They must build critical relationships and show value in the near-term through ‚Äúquick wins,‚Äù as data governance and master data management programs take longer to implement and demonstrate results. It is a hard job with a value proposition not consistently appreciated and with challenges that are critical to overcome to properly serve their stakeholders and the American people.</p>

<p>Federal agencies are at different points of their data journey. While some CDOs have data science teams that are leveraging advanced analytics to derive meaningful insights, others have little to no budget or staffing resources to carry out the initiatives that support their data vision and strategy. A 2020 Gartner survey shows 14% of CDOs have been in their roles for less than a year.1 Many come into their role finding data silos throughout their agency, with  data in disparate places and data functions mostly decentralized. CDO reporting and organizational structures also vary from agency to agency. Despite all this, CDOs must demonstrate early value generation, providing capabilities that build credibility and distinguish themselves as an executive far from the back office with a seat at the leadership table.</p>

<p>Gartner. CDO Agenda 2021: Influence and Impact of Successful CDOs in the Sixth Annual CDO Survey. March 2021.</p>

<p>Federal CDOs come into their role needing a wide array of skills. They must be data evangelists responsible for changing the agency culture to use data to solve real problems and to adopt enterprise data standards that improve overall data quality as a by-product. They must inspire agency offices to engage in a shared unified vision for data by demonstrating they are strategic thinkers who understand how data can drive better agency outcomes and be of greater value to society. Much like the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPMs) five executive core qualifications (ECQs), it takes a variety of leadership skills, both hard and soft,2 to build trusting relationships with key stakeholders and advance the mission of their agency.</p>

<p>According to federal CDOs, persons in this position must have the ability to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Communicate and translate complex concepts to all audiences</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understand and prioritize organizational business challenges and deliver value in these areas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build and lead teams across the organization</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remain goal oriented and focused on reaching specified objectives by establishing structure and managing towards outcomes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adapt and deal with different issues of importance to different customers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Influence others to realize the mission value of data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manage change within organizations The goal of this playbook is to help you be key value drivers as the federal government expands its use of data as a strategic asset.

<h1 id="about-this-playbook">About this playbook</h1>

<p>The CDO Playbook is an iterative document that explores and defines the evolution of the federal CDO role. It provides new and existing CDOs with guiding principles, opportunities for quick wins, and best practices to navigate some of the key areas that CDOs should focus on today and over the next few years. The CDO Council‚Äôs Data Skills Working Group (WG) created this playbook of four key ‚Äúplays‚Äù which draws from successful practices in both industry and government. It is advice from CDOs to other CDOs, hence you will notice the informal tone and admonitions of what ‚Äòyou‚Äô should consider. It leverages and cites concrete examples from federal CDOs on how they have applied specific strategies and approaches to make progress in each Play to deliver value in this evolving role as a change management leader.</p>

<h2 id="the-plays">The plays</h2>

<h3 id="play-1">Play #1</h3>

<p>Cultivate strong relationships to partner on solving mission problems with data.</p>

<h3 id="play-2">Play #2</h3>

<p>Promote data sharing and break organizational silos.</p>

<h3 id="play-3">Play #3</h3>

<p>Build a data-driven culture by taking the lead to improve data literacy and acumen within your agency.</p>

<h3 id="play-4">Play #4</h3>

<p>Drive transformation through a mission focused data and analytics strategy that can influence the enterprise-wide business strategy and answer key agency questions. 
To prepare this playbook, a small working group of CDOs from both large and small agencies participated in discovery meetings to understand how they define their role based on each of their experiences. Their successes, agency culture, pain points, and understanding of data management were assessed to recommend and agree on the four key plays. There is no one-size-fits all approach to the strategies a CDO will execute against these plays and no specific starting point. They are highly interrelated an`d are not prescribed in any order, instead quick wins to demonstrate value are possible from any point throughout all the plays. The information provided unearthed commonalities among people, process, technology, and data distinctions prevalent in many agencies. This playbook is meant to be illustrative and insightful for recognizing value-based opportunities for any agency.</p>

<h1 id="play-1-1">Play #1</h1>

<p>Cultivate strong relationships to partner on solving mission problems with data.</p>

<p>Establish partnerships to realize quick wins - CDOs are most successful when they engage and influence key stakeholders. Your stakeholder engagement strategy should focus on forging relationships before zeroing in on data governance activities that may risk appearing solely compliance driven.</p>

<p>Promote data sharing and break organizational silos.</p>

<p>Effective data management enables data sharing and access across the enterprise which can eliminate data redundancies and lead to overall improved data quality and provide better services. Additionally, data analytics and emerging technologies are dependent on having strong and acceptable data management functions in place, so you have quality data with which to work. The CDO role is to break down organizational silos to foster better transparency and collaboration into the data needed to succeed in transformation projects.</p>

<h2 id="key-strategic-actions-1">Key strategic actions</h2>

<p>2.1 Collaborate with your CIO Office, statistical official, and evaluation officer (if present in your agency) to understand the history of your agency‚Äôs data and infrastructure maturity.</p>

<p>2.2 Identify a strategy to optimally organize and assign data stewards across the enterprise.</p>

<p>2.3 Provide opportunities to train and empower data stewards to be effective in their role.</p>

<p>2.4 Establish an automated means to manage stewardship responsibilities.</p>

<p>2.5 Collaborate with data stewards to develop data lifecycle management best practices. The OPEN Government Data Act mandates that CDOs establish data management best practices to improve the quality of agency data.</p>

<p>2.6 Determine how your data management program will be organized. The data management domains of your program will serve as inputs to your data management strategy (see next step).</p>

<p>2.7 Develop a data management strategy in collaboration with your CIO, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Enterprise Architect or Chief Data Architect, and agency leadership, based on the findings and inputs from earlier action steps. A data management strategy will help you think through how to prioritize investments and resource allocations (e.g., data analytics, data infrastructure).</p>

<p>2.8 Develop an Organizational Change Management (OCM) plan to support your data management strategy. Integrating change management strategies can successfully persuade stakeholders to implement or adjust data management methods or practices.</p>

<p>2.9 Prioritize data sharing projects that generate measurable business outcomes and align with strategic objectives. Using an incremental approach to data management not only delivers benefits to impacted business stakeholders but it also helps you gain quick wins.</p>

<p>2.10 Collaborate with data stewards to develop common business language, such as data term definitions for metadata. Managing metadata vocabularies, formats, and standards ensures a common understanding across the agency of data meaning and its uses.</p>

<p>2.11 Identify data consolidation opportunities across database systems including data sharing and access between business lines. Evaluating data management and analytics capabilities can help you identify open source or shared service opportunities across systems to improve cost efficiency.</p>

<p>2.12 Design a conceptual target data architecture and enterprise solution for databases and other data platforms creating an environment to establish formal data standards. Establishing a target data architecture brings your strategy and the technology side together to show the relationships between your agency‚Äôs data functions, technologies, and types.</p>

<p>2.13 Begin data aggregation activities for data consolidation, integration, and service projects. This action ensures you have compiled and processed all the data from different databases needed for your data projects.</p>

<p>2.14 Define and track performance metrics across your data management program functions and monitor overall progress toward them. The information collected provides feedback and inputs into your data management strategy.</p>

<p>2.15 Routinely assess all agency data management tools and technologies (e.g., data analytics capabilities) including Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) costs for efficiencies. With the evolution of data tools, it is important to constantly evaluate your existing resources to determine where cost savings opportunities are.</p>
