From the U.S. Web Design System [website](https://designsystem.digital.gov/about/):

> ## Our vision

> Empowered agency digital teams share solutions and use effective human-centered design practices.

> ## Our mission

> USWDS is a design system for the federal government. We make it easier to build accessible, mobile-friendly government websites.

> ## History

> USWDS was created by a collaborative team at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) and the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/) in 2015, under the guidance of an advisory board of talented, experienced government workers in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Food and Drug Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security Administration, Department of Education, Internal Revenue Service, and GSA.

> It is currently a project of GSA’s [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services), maintained by the Office of Solutions. Read about the [initial process](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/28/web-design-standards/) as well as [where we’ve been and where we’re going](https://designsystem.digital.gov/whats-new/updates/2017/12/20/2017-where-weve-been-where-were-going/).
