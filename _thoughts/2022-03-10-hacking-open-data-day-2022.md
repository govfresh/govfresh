For [Open Data Day](https://opendataday.org) 2022, my son and I set up [USA.GovFresh](https://usa.govfresh.com).

We started with a [government](https://usa.govfresh.com/government) section that displays all of the U.S. federal agencies, pulling data from the [Federal Register agency API](https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/).

The main government page displays all top-level agencies and other independent organizations maintained by the federal government. 

Each agency profile page (example [USDA](https://usa.govfresh.com/government/?name=agriculture-department)) contains:

* organization name (and shortname)
* organization logo
* short description
* website link
* parent agency link (if any)
* list of the subagencies (if any)
* latest published Federal Register documents

Going forward, we'll use [USA.GovFresh](https://usa.govfresh.com) as a place to build together and learn about government in the context of coding and public data.

If you have ideas for us, add them to the [GitHub issues queue](https://github.com/govfresh/usa/issues).
