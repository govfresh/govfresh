The civic technology community has sadly lost one of its own: [Kevin Joseph Walsh](https://www.gofundme.com/f/kevin-walsh-memorial-fund). 

On July 19, Kev was [struck and killed by a car](https://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/news/local-news/friends-and-family-mourn-death-of-man-killed-while-walking-in-eugenia) while walking with his partner and friends.

Kev was consistently calm, humble and good natured. A complete listener, he was fully present in every conversation. He was equally and genuinely kind to everyone.

In his craft — civic design — Kev was thoughtful, articulate and quietly but significantly impactful. He was a mentor and inspiration, always leading from behind. His work in civic and government service design contributed deeply to the world we all want for our future.

Kev, I will always cherish your witty banter that left me crying with laughter — precious moments of joy you gave me that I will carry forever. I’m grateful to have shared a little bit of time with you. I’m honored to have witnessed your authenticity and unconditional support for others.

The  impression you left — on me and so many others — will forever be remembered with love and gratitude.

A [memorial fund](https://www.gofundme.com/f/kevin-walsh-memorial-fund) has been established to support Kev’s family — his partner and two daughters. If you are a member of the civic technology community, whether you knew Kev or not, I encourage you to [donate](https://www.gofundme.com/f/kevin-walsh-memorial-fund).
