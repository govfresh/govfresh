*(This post is part of an ongoing series documenting adventures in father-son [civic hacking](/civichacking).)*

## README

We built a survey mark finder app from data provided by the National Geodetic Survey. This includes: 

* List of survey marks across the United States
* Pinpoint to current location
* Search survey marks in any location
* Survey mark recovery submission

## Data

Data used for this project:

* [NGS survey marks data](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/datasheets/) (U.S. National Geodetic Survey)

## Kudos

Big kudos to NGS for:

* Providing public data sets.
* Creating a public submission recovery form.

## Demo

GeoMarks app:
