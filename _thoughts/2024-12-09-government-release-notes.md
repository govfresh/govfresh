Government services should include regular release notes to their intended communities. The practice and intent of release notes can be adopted by all government and civic organizations and services.

## About release notes

Release notes are a form of communication typically published by product companies to update users on new features and changes. They are usually high-level overviews, user-friendly, explanatory and written in a narrative format, though all of this is subject to the intended audience.

Similar to release notes are changelogs. These are more technical and detailed, usually focused on developers.

## Why they matter

Whether general or technical, government release notes:

* Transparently communicate the work
* Build a sense of trust and commitment
* Keep end users and stakeholders updated
* Document the product or service’s evolution
* Show public services are continuously improving

## Examples

While directed to a technical audience, the [U.S. Web Design System](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/releases) is an example of great government release notes.

[GitLabs](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) release notes are in a blog format that is aesthetic and detailed. [GitHub Desktop’s](https://desktop.github.com/release-notes/) are in a simple timeline with links to respective issues in the release (which are well-written and thorough).

ProudCity (disclosure: I’m a co-founder and board member) includes changelog-like release notes in its monthly newsletter. They are done in a [Smart Brevity](https://bookshop.org/a/83650/9781523516971) style format and sent via email and [posted to the website](https://proudcity.com/category/fyi).

## Best practices

Recommendations for great release notes:

* Don’t embellish.
* Know your audience.
* Include feedback mechanisms.
* Publish regularly/consistently.
* Give multiple subscription options (email/RSS/social media).

## Parting thoughts

Whether it’s a digital project or public service, government should publish release notes of some kind. They don’t need to be technical or exhaustive, just regular and informative.

Communications teams can especially benefit from publishing regular release notes. This would be a better and authentic use of their skills than press releases or embellished blog posts. (Note: This is not an invitation for comms folks to write or review technical release notes. These should be left to technical/documentation writers and managers.)

Who needs release notes (or a changelog)?

“People do,” says [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). “Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software are human beings who care about what's in the software. When the software changes, people want to know why and how.“

While this references software, it's especially pertinent to government services.
