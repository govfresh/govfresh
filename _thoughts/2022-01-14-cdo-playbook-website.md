At the beginning of 2022, the U.S. Chief Data Officers Council [published a playbook](/radar/cdo-council-2021-playbook) to help CDOs “lead data-driven transformation” within their agencies.

What struck me as odd -- especially coming from an organization that should always default to an open, data-driven approach to everything it does -- was that the playbook itself came in only one format: A very unstructured, inaccessible, proprietary PDF.

Disappointed by this, I built a [web-based version](https://cdoplaybook.govfresh.com) ([repository](https://github.com/govfresh/cdo-playbook)) to make it more accessible to everyone.

## Recommendations to the CDO Council

In the future, I hope the CDO Council -- and every government agency -- publishes information like this in open, accessible and, ideally, machine-readable formats. My hope is that [my version of the CDO playbook](https://cdoplaybook.govfresh.com), while not perfect, is an example of how to do this.

I also would like to see the CDO Council add RSS functionality to its website (as a data-driven approach to sharing updates). While a seemingly trivial point, the federal government desperately needs a simple, standard strategy for publishing information, particularly blogs and news, in a more API-like format.

Other suggestions for the CDO Council:

* Move the playbook to a public repository, as a living document that others can re-purpose or contribute to (similar to the [Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/)).
* Add a fifth play focused on privacy/security.
* Strongly recommend all federal agencies have an RSS strategy.
* Strongly recommend an end to government use of PDFs (unless they are accompanied by an open alternative).
