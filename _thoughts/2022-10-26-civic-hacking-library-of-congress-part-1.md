## README

In [October](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2022/09/introducing-the-congress-gov-api/), the Library of Congress published a Congress.gov application programming interface. Using this API, we created House of Representatives, Senate and member profiles pages on [USA.GovFresh](https://usa.govfresh.com).
