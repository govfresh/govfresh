*(This post is part of an ongoing series documenting adventures in father-son [civic hacking](/civichacking).)*

## README

We built a ]national parks directory](https://usa.govfresh.com/pars) using the U.S. National Park Service API. This includes: 

* Listing of all national parks
* Individual parks pages

Each park page includes:

* About
* Contact
* Hours
* Activities
* Campgrounds
* Directions
* Parking
* Entrance fees
* Passes
* Weather
* Map
* Photos
* Videos
* Articles
* Tags

## Data

Data used for this project:

* [National parks API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm) (National Parks Service)
* Google Maps

## Kudos

Big kudos to NPS for:

* Maintaining a public aaplication programming interface of the data.
