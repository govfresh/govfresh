After reading about Google NotebookLM's new deep dive audio feature, I’m now using it to create my own personal podcast to help me learn more about government technology.

## Background

[Google NotebookLM](https://support.google.com/notebooklm/answer/14273541?hl=en) is an AI-powered note-taking and research tool that analyzes documents and generates FAQs, study guides, timelines, briefings and more. It now [lets you create podcast-like overviews](https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/).

## Episodes

Using source material from official government websites, PDFs and YouTube channels, I’ve created episodes and overview pages for these [topics](/research):

* [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://govfresh.com/research/idea-act-delivering-digital-first-public-experience)
* [FedRAMP](https://govfresh.com/research/fedramp)
* [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://govfresh.com/research/nist-cybersecurity-framework)
* [TechFAR](https://govfresh.com/research/techfar)
* [Zero Trust](https://govfresh.com/research/zero-trust)

## Takeaways

* This is an extremely helpful way to process information, especially if you just need an overview of inevitably complex government technology topics.
* The content flow feels organized and seamless.
* The AI hosts are relatively believable and engaging.
* There are slight glitches in the conversations, but very rarely.
* Government acronyms aren’t always accurately pronounced.
* The conversations actually makes government technology entertaining.
