## Summary

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 is a set of voluntary guidelines that help organizations manage cybersecurity risks. It includes six main functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The framework helps organizations assess their cybersecurity, prioritize actions, and communicate risks. It also provides tools like Informative References, Implementation Examples, and Quick Start Guides to support understanding and application. Each function has clear steps for organizations to follow to improve their cybersecurity defenses and responses.

## FAQs

**What is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0?**

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 is a voluntary set of guidelines and best practices designed to help organizations of all sizes and sectors manage and reduce their cybersecurity risks. It provides a common language and structure for understanding, assessing, prioritizing, and communicating cybersecurity efforts.

**What are the six core functions of the CSF 2.0?**

The CSF 2.0 is organized around six core functions:

* **Identify (ID):** Develop an understanding of your organization's systems, assets, data, and cybersecurity risks.
* **Protect (PR):** Implement safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services and limit or contain the impact of a cybersecurity event.
* **Detect (DE):** Develop and implement appropriate activities to identify cybersecurity events.
* **Respond (RS):** Take action to contain the impact of a cybersecurity incident.
* **Recover (RC):** Maintain plans for resilience and restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event.
* **Govern (GV):** Develop and implement the activities needed to enable risk management and the other five functions.

**How are CSF Profiles used?**

CSF Profiles help organizations align the Framework to their specific needs, priorities, and resources. There are two types of profiles:

* **Organizational Profiles:** Describe an organization’s current and/or target cybersecurity posture.
* **Community Profiles:** Offer a baseline of cybersecurity outcomes specific to a sector, industry, or technology. Organizations can use these as a starting point for developing their own profiles.

**What are CSF Tiers and how are they used?**

CSF Tiers characterize the rigor of an organization’s cybersecurity risk management practices. They help organizations understand their current maturity level and guide their cybersecurity improvement efforts. The four tiers range from Partial (Tier 1), Risk Informed (Tier 2), Repeatable (Tier 3), to Adaptive (Tier 4).

**How does the CSF 2.0 address supply chain risks?**

The CSF 2.0 emphasizes the importance of cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM). It provides guidance on:

* Identifying and assessing risks associated with suppliers and third-party vendors.
* Establishing clear cybersecurity requirements for suppliers.
* Monitoring and managing supply chain risks throughout the relationship.

**How does the CSF 2.0 relate to Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)?**

The CSF 2.0 can be integrated with an organization's broader ERM program to provide a comprehensive approach to risk management. NIST provides resources on aligning cybersecurity risk management with ERM principles and practices.

**What is the relationship between cybersecurity and privacy in the CSF 2.0?**

The CSF 2.0 recognizes the close relationship between cybersecurity and privacy. It highlights the importance of protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data. NIST provides additional guidance on integrating the CSF with the NIST Privacy Framework.

**Where can I find additional resources on the CSF 2.0?**

NIST provides a wealth of resources on the CSF 2.0, including:

* **Quick Start Guides:** Offer tailored guidance for specific use cases (e.g., small businesses, ERM practitioners).
* **Informative References:** Provide mappings between the CSF and other relevant standards and guidelines.
* **Cybersecurity & Privacy Reference Tool (CPRT):** Allows users to browse, download, and map CSF content.
