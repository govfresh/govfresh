## Summary

The Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) is a project developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in collaboration with industry to promote standardized, machine-readable formats for representing security control information. OSCAL aims to transition away from traditional document-based methods of managing security plans, by utilizing XML, JSON, and YAML to facilitate automated processes and the sharing of control data between different systems and tools. This approach enables more efficient control-based risk management by standardizing how security controls are represented and utilized, supporting automated assessments and the development of next-generation compliance tools.

## FAQs

**What is OSCAL?**

OSCAL stands for Open Security Controls Assessment Language. Developed by NIST, it is a set of standardized, machine-readable formats for representing security control information. OSCAL enables automation and interoperability in security processes, moving away from manual, document-based approaches.

**What are the key benefits of using OSCAL?**

OSCAL offers numerous benefits, including:



* Automation: Automates security assessment tasks, like control implementation documentation, assessment plan creation, and results reporting.
* Interoperability: Enables seamless data exchange between different security tools and systems, avoiding vendor lock-in.
* Efficiency: Streamlines compliance processes, reduces manual effort, and allows for continuous monitoring.
* Traceability: Provides clear links between security controls, implementations, and assessment activities.

**How does OSCAL work?**

OSCAL utilizes a layered architecture with different models:



* Control Layer: Defines security controls and catalogs.
* Implementation Layer: Documents system security plans and component definitions.
* Assessment Layer: Covers assessment plans, results, and plans of action and milestones (POA&Ms).

These models are expressed in machine-readable formats like XML, JSON, and YAML, facilitating data exchange and processing.

**Who are the key stakeholders that benefit from OSCAL?**

OSCAL caters to various stakeholders:



* Security Professionals: Use OSCAL to document control implementations and manage system security.
* Assessors: Employ OSCAL for planning, executing, and reporting security assessments.
* Tool Developers: Integrate OSCAL into security tools to enable automation and data exchange.
* Policy Authors: Define and tailor security controls using OSCAL catalogs and profiles.

**How does OSCAL support various regulatory frameworks?**

OSCAL's generic structure allows it to represent security controls from multiple frameworks like NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, and FedRAMP. This enables organizations to manage compliance across different standards using a single, consistent approach.

**How is FedRAMP using OSCAL?**

FedRAMP is leveraging OSCAL to automate and streamline its security authorization and assessment processes. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) can use OSCAL to submit system security plans (SSPs), assessment plans, and results to FedRAMP in a standardized format.

**What resources are available for learning more about OSCAL?**

The NIST OSCAL website (pages.nist.gov/oscal) provides comprehensive information, including:



* Documentation: Model specifications, examples, and schemas.
* Tools: Open-source tools for working with OSCAL data.
* Community Resources: Forums, mailing lists, and events for collaboration and support.

**How can I contribute to the OSCAL project?**

NIST encourages community involvement in OSCAL development. You can contribute by:



* Providing feedback on the models and schemas.
* Developing open-source tools and integrations.
* Creating OSCAL content and examples.
* Participating in community discussions and events.
