## Summary

The Strengthening Agency Management and Oversight of Software Assets Act (H.R. 1695) requires federal agencies to take a more strategic approach to managing their software assets. The bill mandates that each agency conduct a comprehensive assessment of its software inventory, including a detailed accounting of all software used, associated costs, and any restrictions on deployment or usage. This assessment must then be used to develop a plan that focuses on consolidating software licenses, adopting cost-effective acquisition strategies like enterprise licensing, and improving interoperability. To ensure government-wide coordination, the OMB will establish processes for standardizing definitions, terms, and requirements related to software management, and the GAO will report on agency compliance and overall trends. Importantly, the bill does not authorize additional funds for implementation, meaning agencies will need to find ways to improve software management within their existing budgets.

## FAQs

### What is the purpose of the Strengthening Agency Management and Oversight of Software Assets Act?

This bill, also known as H.R. 1695, aims to improve how federal agencies manage their software assets. It focuses on enhancing visibility, accountability, and oversight regarding the purchase, use, and deployment of software within the government.

### What are the key requirements for federal agencies under this Act?

Agencies must conduct a comprehensive assessment of their software assets, including a detailed inventory, cost accounting, and analysis of interoperability. Based on this assessment, they need to develop a modernization plan to consolidate software licenses, adopt cost-effective acquisition strategies (like enterprise licensing), and restrict unauthorized software acquisition.

### What role does the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) play in this Act?

The OMB plays a crucial role in supporting and coordinating the implementation of this Act. They provide guidance to agencies on conducting comprehensive assessments and developing their modernization plans. They also submit a strategy to Congress with proposals for government-wide enterprise licenses, leveraging procurement policies for better interoperability, and exploring transitions to open-source software.

### What is the role of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) under this Act?

The GAO is tasked with producing a report that analyzes the effectiveness of the Act's implementation across the government. This report covers trends in software asset management practices across agencies, comparisons between different agencies' approaches, and an evaluation of the OMB's processes for harmonizing software-related definitions and terms.

### How does the Act address potential conflicts of interest when agencies contract external support?

The Act specifically prohibits agencies from engaging contractors with conflicts of interest. This means contractors involved in integrating, managing, or operating the agency's software inventory and entitlements cannot be involved in the comprehensive assessment. This ensures the assessment's objectivity and independence.

### What are the requirements for handling software asset management within the intelligence community?

Recognizing the sensitivity of information within the intelligence community, the Act mandates separate comprehensive assessments for each element. These assessments are conducted internally by entities designated by the head of each element, ensuring the protection of national security information. The findings are submitted in summarized form to specific Congressional committees.

### Does the Act provide additional funding to agencies for implementation?

No, the Act explicitly states that no additional funds are authorized for its implementation. This means agencies are expected to utilize existing resources and budgets to fulfill the requirements of the Act.

### What is the current status of the Strengthening Agency Management and Oversight of Software Assets Act?

The Act has been passed by the House of Representatives and is currently in the Senate, placed on the legislative calendar. Its progress can be followed on Congress.gov, where updates on its status and any future actions will be documented.
