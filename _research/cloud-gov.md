## Summary

cloud.gov is a government-run platform that allows federal agencies to build, manage, and host websites and applications in the cloud. It offers a variety of features, including free trial sandboxes, prototyping packages, and production packages that can be tailored to different agency needs. cloud.gov is FedRAMP authorized, meaning it meets federal security standards. This makes it easier for agencies to build compliant applications without needing to invest significant time and resources in security infrastructure. The platform also boasts increased scalability and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional on-premise infrastructure.

## FAQs


**What is cloud.gov?**

cloud.gov is a secure and compliant Platform as a Service (PaaS) designed specifically for government work. It helps federal agencies build, run, and authorize cloud-ready or legacy government systems quickly and cheaply. Essentially, cloud.gov manages the underlying server infrastructure, including security and maintenance, while your development team focuses on building products that serve your agency’s mission.

**Who can use cloud.gov?**

cloud.gov is available to any team serving a federal government organization that can utilize the Interagency Agreement (IAA/MOU) process to pay for the service. Currently, U.S. local, state, tribal, or territory government organizations cannot use cloud.gov.

**How does cloud.gov ensure security and compliance?**

cloud.gov boasts a FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) at the Moderate impact level, making it compliant with federal security requirements. It runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud, which has a FedRAMP JAB P-ATO at the High impact level and offers support for other compliance needs like ITAR. By using cloud.gov, you inherit most of the necessary FISMA controls and benefit from their regularly updated documentation and controls, simplifying your ATO process.

**What are the benefits of using cloud.gov?**

cloud.gov offers several benefits, including:



* **Cost savings:** cloud.gov’s PaaS model and automated infrastructure management save you the expense of managing your own cloud deployments.
* **Enhanced security:** Built-in security features, like immutable infrastructure and a hardened operating system image, protect your applications from vulnerabilities.
* **Simplified compliance:** cloud.gov streamlines compliance with federal requirements like FISMA and FedRAMP, simplifying your ATO process and reducing associated time and effort.
* **Increased efficiency:** You can instantly set up environments, manage user access, deploy applications, scale resources, monitor performance, and access your running applications, all through a user-friendly interface.
* **Streamlined procurement:** cloud.gov is a readily available service with transparent, predictable monthly quota-based billing, eliminating procurement hassles and the risk of overspending.

**What types of applications are supported on cloud.gov?**

cloud.gov supports a broad range of applications, including websites and non-website applications for both internal and public use. It accommodates various technology stacks, such as Linux (64-bit ABI) operating system, programming languages like Go, Java, .NET Core, Node.js, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, and backing services like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, and S3. To determine if your application is suitable, consider its security impact level (FISMA Low, Moderate, or DoD Impact Level 2) and its cloud operations readiness, ideally aligning with 12-Factor App guidelines.

**What are the different pricing options for cloud.gov?**

cloud.gov offers various pricing packages:



* **Sandbox:** Free sandbox environments for experimenting and testing.
* **Prototyping:** $1780 per month for full access for an entire organization, allowing development of non-production systems.
* **Production:** Ranging from $2380 per month for FISMA Low systems to $10700 per month for FISMA Moderate and DoD Impact Level 2 systems.

Monthly costs comprise the package fee plus memory usage ($130/GB RAM per month), with most customers typically reserving 4–8 GB of memory. Additional charges apply for exceeding included storage and services.

**How can I get started with cloud.gov?**

You can start with a free Sandbox environment by simply providing a federal email address. To access more features and deploy applications in production, you can choose a suitable pricing package and initiate the Interagency Agreement (IAA/MOU) process. cloud.gov provides self-service tools and resources, including the cloud.gov command line interface and documentation, to manage your applications and environments.

**What is the cloud.gov team's mission and approach?**

The cloud.gov team, part of the U.S. General Services Administration's Technology Transformation Service, aims to empower agencies to deliver public services quickly and efficiently. They believe in applying best practices in security and compliance while minimizing effort. They achieve this by offering a secure, compliant, and user-friendly PaaS solution, continuously developing and improving cloud.gov based on customer feedback and industry best practices.
