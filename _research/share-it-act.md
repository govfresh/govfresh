## FAQs



### What is the SHARE IT Act?

The SHARE IT Act, or the Source Code Harmonization and Reuse in Information Technology Act, is a bipartisan law that requires federal agencies to share custom-developed software code with each other. This aims to eliminate wasteful spending on redundant software development and procurement.


### Why was the SHARE IT Act introduced?

The federal government spends billions of dollars annually on software, with a significant portion dedicated to custom-developed software for specific agency needs. However, despite existing platforms for code sharing, agencies rarely shared this custom code, leading to duplication and wasted taxpayer money. The SHARE IT Act addresses this inefficiency by mandating code sharing and establishing accountability mechanisms.


### How does the SHARE IT Act work?

The SHARE IT Act mandates that federal agencies share their custom-developed software code, including documentation, architecture designs, and metadata, in public or private repositories. This code must be owned by the agency and accessible to other federal employees. The law also requires agencies to publicly list their custom code and update their acquisition policies to comply with the SHARE IT Act.


### What are the exemptions to the SHARE IT Act?

The SHARE IT Act exempts certain types of code from mandatory sharing to protect national security, privacy, and other sensitive information. These exemptions include:



* Classified source code
* Code developed for national security systems
* Code developed by intelligence community elements
* Code whose disclosure would violate other federal laws or regulations
* Code whose disclosure would create an identifiable risk to individual privacy


### Who is responsible for implementing the SHARE IT Act?

The Chief Information Officer (CIO) of each federal agency is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the SHARE IT Act within their agency. They must develop agency-wide policies for code sharing, determine exemptions, and submit annual compliance reports. The Administrator of the Office of Electronic Government provides guidance and publishes an annual report on the implementation of the Act.


### Does the SHARE IT Act require additional funding?

No, the SHARE IT Act does not require additional funding. Agencies can utilize existing government infrastructure, such as code.gov, open-source tools, or commercial platforms, to share code. The Act leverages existing resources to promote efficiency and cost savings.


### What are the benefits of the SHARE IT Act?

The SHARE IT Act is expected to bring several benefits, including:



* Reduced government spending: By sharing code, agencies can avoid redundant software development, saving taxpayer money.
* Increased efficiency: Code sharing streamlines software procurement and development processes, freeing up resources for other priorities.
* Enhanced transparency: Public listing of custom code increases transparency and accountability within government software development.
* Fostering innovation: Access to shared code can inspire new ideas and solutions, fostering innovation across government agencies.


### When did the SHARE IT Act become law?

The SHARE IT Act was introduced in the Senate on January 16, 2024, and in the House of Representatives on September 12, 2024. It passed both chambers of Congress and was signed into law on December 23, 2024, becoming Public Law No: 118-187.
