Richard Goerling is bringing needed presence to the people who have taken an oath to serve and protect us.

A certified mindfulness trainer, retired police officer and military veteran, Richard is the founder of [Mindful Badge](https://www.mindfulbadge.com/), a consultancy that trains health, resilience and human performance skills to first responders and other high reliability professionals. By teaching these skills – emphasizing a practice of awareness and compassion – he is giving all members of law enforcement an opportunity to not only pioneer a new way of policing, but also to transform themselves, their organizations and the communities they serve.

Richard speaking on [The Government We Need](https://thegovweneed.com/episode/how-government-can-bring-mindfulness-to-law-enforcement):

> We could give the officers all kinds of information, which is accurate, and it does nothing. What we have to teach is skill. And when we’re talking about police officers, and frankly many other professions, maybe any profession, teaching skills and self-awareness, self-regulation, self-compassion are the foundation for how we show up in the world in service to others. It’s really that simple. And, the same skills make us more capable of regulating that arousal on the job. Of taking in data on the job under extreme stress, making sense of that data under extreme stress, and making the most informed decision we can make in that moment under extreme stress.
